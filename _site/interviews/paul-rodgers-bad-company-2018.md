You know the songs: "All Right Now", "Bad Company", "Feel Like Makin' Love", "Rock 'N' Roll Fantasy", to name just a few. You know the bands - *Free*; *Bad Company*. And of course you know the voice - *Rolling Stone* ranked him as one of the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time."

He's *Paul Rodgers*, and he's bringing his incredible vocals to the *Resch Center* this Saturday, for the *Bad Company* with *Cheap Trick* & *Femmes of Rock* show.

**WM:**
It's an honor, Paul. Have you ever played in *Green Bay* before?

> **PR:** No, I don't believe we have.

**WM:**
How did you first start singing?

> **PR:** *Otis Redding* got me started when I heard his songs. "A Change Is Gonna Come", "Down In The Valley", and "Mr. Pitiful." Then I heard *Sam & Dave*, and then *the Temptations*. I thought, "Wow, that's what I wanna do."

**WM:**
How old were you when you first started?

> **PR:** I was in school actually ... around fourteen years old. I had a guitar, so that made me eligible to join the class band. We all got together in somebody's mum's kitchen and made a heck of a racket. And I stayed with it. Music got into my blood and it's been there since. I've been living, actually, a Rock n Roll Fantasy. I went down to London, I met up with *Paul Kossoff*, and we formed *Free*. We wrote "All Right Now" and it became an international hit. Suddenly we were famous. I went on to form *Bad Company* with *Mick Ralphs*, and it's been a wild ride.

**WM:**
You've been around for decades and have a lot of great songs. Have you ever thought about making another *Bad Company* album of new material?

> **PR:** Well, that's always a possibility. There's a lot of new songs. Actually, I've been revisiting a lot of the *Free* songs lately. I did a tour with *Jeff Beck* and *Ann Wilson* where I did a lot of that old material and it was amazing. As a result of that I'm including the song "All Right Now" into the *Bad Company* set. It's a very very powerful song. Being that *Simon (Kirke)* and I were in *Free*, it makes sense. It fits in with the *Bad Company* catalog seamlessly. 

**WM:**
So you will be playing "All Right Now" when you play in *Green Bay*?

> **PR:** Yes, we actually will! It's an arena-type song with big heavy chords and a good story line. 

**WM:**
You've been working with Simon for decades now. How old were you both when you started playing together?

> **PR:** We were very young when we kicked off with *Free*. Andy, the bass player, was fourteen when we started! By the time "All Right Now" hit Simon and I were in our early twenties.

**WM:**
You've lasted longer than many marriages. What makes it work between the two of you?

> **PR:** I think it's musical. We have a musical compatibility. I like *Otis Redding* and he likes the drummer with *Otis Redding*. So we have that rapport, and it's very good.

**WM:** You've had a lot of great hits, and on top of it you've had the privilege of singing and touring with *Queen*. How did that come about?

> **PR:** Well, we did a TV show together and they didn't have a singer. Brian came to me and said if you sing "We Will Rock You" for us, we'll be your backing band for "All Right Now." That sounded like a pretty good deal, to have *Queen* as your backing band! So we played together and the chemistry was so good we decided to do a European tour. That tour turned into four years! They actually played a lot of my material too and they did an amazing job. At the end of that time, I thought it was time for me to get back to my own roots. And that's what I'm doing now. 

Over the years we've had a lot of strong songs that allow us to have a strong set when *Bad Company* performs. But I went to see "A Star Is Born" last night at the theater, and saw the preview for the new *Queen* movie. It looks very impressive! 

**WM:**
Yes, it does! The *Green Bay* concert benefits a lot of both local and national charities. Do you have any charitable organizations that are near and dear to your heart?

> **PR:** Yes, the *Red Cross* and everything they're doing with hurricane relief, absolutely. We do a lot of charity work ourselves, and we're happy to help. It's a feel-good thing!
