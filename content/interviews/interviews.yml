You know the songs: "All Right Now", "Bad Company", "Feel Like Makin'
Love", "Rock 'N' Roll Fantasy", to name just a few. You know the bands - *Free*;
*Bad Company*. And of course you know the voice - *Rolling Stone* ranked him as
one of the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time."

He's *Paul Rodgers*, and he's
bringing his incredible vocals to the *Resch Center* this Saturday, for the *Bad
Company* with *Cheap Trick* & *Femmes of Rock* show.

**WM:**
It's an honor, Paul. Have you ever played in *Green Bay* before?

> **PR:** No, I don't believe we have.

**WM:** How did you first start singing?

> **PR:** *Otis Redding* got me started when I heard his songs. "A Change Is Gonna
Come", "Down In The Valley", and "Mr. Pitiful." Then I heard *Sam & Dave*,
and then *the Temptations*. I thought, "Wow, that's what I wanna do."

**WM:**
How old were you when you first started?

> **PR:** I was in school actually
... around fourteen years old. I had a guitar, so that made me eligible to join
the class band. We all got together in somebody's mum's kitchen and made a heck
of a racket. And I stayed with it. Music got into my blood and it's been there
since. I've been living, actually, a Rock n Roll Fantasy. I went down to London,
I met up with *Paul Kossoff*, and we formed *Free*. We wrote "All Right Now"
and it became an international hit. Suddenly we were famous. I went on to form
*Bad Company* with *Mick Ralphs*, and it's been a wild ride.

![image](/assets/img/interview_paul3.jpg)

**WM:**
You've been around for decades and have a lot of great songs. Have you ever thought
about making another *Bad Company* album of new material?

> **PR:** Well, that's
always a possibility. There's a lot of new songs. Actually, I've been revisiting
a lot of the *Free* songs lately. I did a tour with *Jeff Beck* and *Ann Wilson*
where I did a lot of that old material and it was amazing. As a result of that
I'm including the song "All Right Now" into the *Bad Company* set. It's a very
very powerful song. Being that *Simon (Kirke)* and I were in *Free*, it makes
sense. It fits in with the *Bad Company* catalog seamlessly. 

**WM:** So you
will be playing "All Right Now" when you play in *Green Bay*?

> **PR:** Yes,
we actually will! It's an arena-type song with big heavy chords and a good story
line. 

**WM:** You've been working with Simon for decades now. How old were you
both when you started playing together?

> **PR:** We were very young when we
kicked off with *Free*. Andy, the bass player, was fourteen when we started! By
the time "All Right Now" hit Simon and I were in our early twenties.

**WM:**
You've lasted longer than many marriages. What makes it work between the two of
you?

> **PR:** I think it's musical. We have a musical compatibility. I like
*Otis Redding* and he likes the drummer with *Otis Redding*. So we have that rapport,
and it's very good. 

![image](/assets/img/interview_paul4.jpg)

**WM:** You've
had a lot of great hits, and on top of it you've had the privilege of singing
and touring with *Queen*. How did that come about?

> **PR:** Well, we did a
TV show together and they didn't have a singer. Brian came to me and said if you
sing "We Will Rock You" for us, we'll be your backing band for "All Right Now."
That sounded like a pretty good deal, to have *Queen* as your backing band! So
we played together and the chemistry was so good we decided to do a European tour.
That tour turned into four years! They actually played a lot of my material too
and they did an amazing job. At the end of that time, I thought it was time for
me to get back to my own roots. And that's what I'm doing now. 

Over the years
we've had a lot of strong songs that allow us to have a strong set when *Bad Company*
performs. But I went to see "A Star Is Born" last night at the theater, and
saw the preview for the new *Queen* movie. It looks very impressive! 

**WM:**
Yes, it does! The *Green Bay* concert benefits a lot of both local and national
charities. Do you have any charitable organizations that are near and dear to
your heart?

> **PR:** Yes, the *Red Cross* and everything they're doing with
hurricane relief, absolutely. We do a lot of charity work ourselves, and we're
happy to help. It's a feel-good thing!

A lot can change in forty years... but some things never do. Forty years
ago I was able to meet *Cheap Trick*. The band was extremely nice. They didn't
have to hang out and talk, take pictures and sign autographsâ€¦ but they did. Later
in life, I came to realize what I know now. *Cheap Trick* is an amazing band.
And more importantly to me, they down-to-earth and great guys. Cheap Trick will
be back in Green Bay, along with Bad Company and the Femmes of Rock, on October
27th at the Resch Center. Forty years after my first conversation with him, I
was again able to chat with Cheap Trick bass guitarist *Tom Petersson*.

![image](/assets/img/interview_tom4.jpg)

**WM:** You were the first rock star I ever met!

> **TP:** Is that right?


**WM:** It was in 1988 on the *Lap Of Luxury* tour. I had a teacher that also
ran a high school radio station that I was a part of. She scored tickets and passes,
and I was one of the lucky ones to go. 

> **TP:** We have lots of history
there. When we first started we would play *Green Bay*... once a month for six
nights straight. Five sets a night at the *Pack and the Hounds*. There were about
five people that would come to see us. I was just talking the other day about
how great it would be to talk to one of those original fans that would see us,
as it's such a small group to choose from. But if she was one of the five, it
would be interesting. Our friend Daryl was in a *Led Zeppelin* cover band and
they would all come and watch us. So I take that back, maybe there was ten people
there total. (laughs) 

**WM:** What year was that?

> **TP:** That would
have been either 1973 or 1974. 

**WM:** So before those club days you were in
another band with *Rick Nielsen* called *Fuse*?

> **TP:** Yeah, and we had
a record deal with *Epic Records* in 1969. We did one album that didn't turn out
so great, and we were dropped. 

It was disappointing because we were a great
live group. We went into the studio with the wrong producer and it did not translate
well. It didn't sound like us at all. 

**WM:** So then you formed *Cheap Trick*
and started playing the club circuit until you were discovered in *Waukesha* at
a bowling alley?

> **TP:** It was at the *Sunset Bowl*. There was another
room that was a bar with a stage attached to the bowling alley. *Jack Douglas*,
who was a successful producer for *Aerosmith* at that point, was in *Waukesha*
with his wife because her relatives were from there. He saw us at the bowling
alley and told us that he would love to produce a record for us. Once the record
labels heard that he wanted to produce us, it was all over. We weren't good enough
before that, but once Jack expressed interest there was a bidding war! We'd been
turned down by everybody before that. But now we're suddenly brilliant! (laughs)
Thanks Jack! 

**WM:** Any other *Wisconsin* memories? 

> **TP:** Oh yeah.
I basically grew up in *Wisconsin* -- half of my relatives are from *Milwaukee*.
Much of our early career was in *Wisconsin* because our manager was based out
of *Madison*. We grew up ten miles from the *Wisconsin* border right below *Beloit*.
But as a band we played everywhere in your state: *Appleton*, *Green Bay*, *Ripon*,
*Janesville*, *Beloit, *Lake Geneva*, *Madison*, and *Milwaukee*. 

We really
started to do well in *Milwaukee*. At that point we hadn't even played *Chicago*
at all. The band started to build a following before we even started playing in
*Chicago*. Then we slowly got a following. 

We saved up all our money to drive
across the country to play three nights at the *Starwood* in *LA* to ten people.
But ten different people than the ones in *Green Bay*! (laughs) We didn't get
any interest there, so it was back to the *Wisconsin clubs*. We just couldn't
secure a record deal until *Jack Douglas* saw us. 

**WM:** I read that in 1976
you played *Summerfest* and the fans confused you with *Peter Frampton*?

> **TP:** Yes, from a great distance. Apparently back then anyone with somewhat long,
curly hair can pass for *Peter Frampton*! (more laughs) I've never gotten that
before, or since! We were standing backstage and the fans were about a hundred
yards back behind a chain-link fence. I unwisely jumped up on top of a limo and
started waving at the fans, and they thought it was *Frampton*. On the stage playing
was *Bachman Turner Overdrive* (BTO) and I totally distracted the crowd from their
show, which I did not mean to do. Their manager came over yelling, he wasn't too
happy with me.

![image](/assets/img/interview_tom3.jpg)

**WM:** Earlier
this year *Cheap Trick* released a new song called "Summer Looks Good On You."
Will you be playing that at the *Green Bay* show?

> **TP:** Well now we're
used to doing it, so yes we'll play it. I keep thinking when would be a good time
to stop playing it, as it's not really summer anymore. We have a Christmas record
full of material we can start leaning onâ€¦ 

**WM:** Whoaâ€¦ slow down. Let's get
through fall first! (laughs) Are you still working on your new album?

> **TP:** It's almost done. We just tied up a few loose ends with it yesterday when
Robin was in town.

**WM:** Any release date on it yet?

> **TP:** No, not
yet. But now we can start all over on a new one! (laughs)

**WM:** So other than
"Summer Looks Good On You", any other new material you might play at the *Resch
Center*?

> **TP:** I don't know yet. We really change things up on the spur
of the moment. It drives our crew crazy. Sometimes we change things last minute
and then go through it at sound check or we might have some instruments backstage.
It's impossible to remember all our material, especially the newer stuff.

**WM:**
When I think of *Tom Petersson*, I think of you on stand-up bass playing 'Don't
Be Cruel' back in 1988. How did you playing that come about? 

> **TP:** Well,
it really wasn't a stand-up bass. It was just my 12 string bass attached to a
pool que. It was a bit wobbly, but I would just play it on that song since it
was an *Elvis* cover. 

**WM:** A lot of non-profit charities will get a portion
of the proceeds for this concert, like the *Red Cross* and their efforts to provide
relief to those affected by *Hurricane Florence*; the *American Cancer Society*;
the *Brown County Heroin Treatment Court*; and the *Miracle League of the Lakeshore*
that gives children with disabilities the chance to play baseball. Are there any
charities that you feel strongly about?

> **TP:** There's one that's not a
charity, but a music program that my wife Alison and I have worked on for several
years. We started it to help our son with speech therapy, as he's autistic. It's
call *Rock Your Speech*. We've changed it from just autism to music therapy in
general.

**WM:** I'll make sure to include the link. We are highly looking forward
to your show in *Green Bay*!

> **TP:** We don't have to do five sets there
in *Green Bay* anymore, do we? (laughs)

**WM:** You can if you want, I'm sure
the crowd won't mind! And I can guarantee you'll have more than ten people! 

> **TP:** OK, you tell *Paul Rodgers* he'll have to wait another four hours
before he hits the stage! (more laughs) We'll see you soon!

Songs you hear on the radio... sing in the car... kick off your favorite
playlists? Simon Kirke played drums on some of the best. As the original drummer
for legendary bands *Free* and *Bad Company*, he's played on classic songs that
have long been a part of popular culture. 

Still touring and playing music,
Simon - and the rest of *Bad Company* - will play *Green Bay* on October 27th
at *the Resch Center*. This show, with *Femmes of Rock* and *Cheap Trick*, is
one of only four shows *Band Company* will play in the US this year! 

![image](/assets/img/interview_simon1.jpg)

**WM:** You've been in two extremely successful and well-known bands. Does it
ever get old playing certain songs over the years?

> **SK:** In *Bad Company*
we don't play any *Free* songs. But when I played with *Ringo Starr* I sang "Shooting
Star" and "All Right Now." So "All Right Now" is really the only song from
the Free days that I play. I still love playing it, it's a lovely beat to play
along to. It's tricky because it's not a straight beat all the way through. And
it brings back very nice memories for me.

**WM:** How old were you when you
recorded that song?

> **SK:** I was twenty-one, and I was the oldest in the
band! (laughs) *Paul Rodgers* is six months younger than me, and we were the oldest
in the group. We were a very young band.

**WM:** So a lot of these songs you've
been playing for decades. Are there certain songs you would like to never play
again?

> **SK:** Wowâ€¦ I have to be careful here! (laughs) We play about sixteen
or seventeen songs in our set. Honestly, pretty much all of them I still enjoy
playing. There are certain songs that are physically hard to play. The end section
of the song "Bad Company" is really quite exacting. Especially down south on
a summer night, where the air is very humid. But there's nothing that I wouldn't
play in our set list... that I don't mind playing.

**WM:** Last year you put
out a solo release called *All Because Of You*. How did that come about and what's
the response been to it?

> **SK:** I'm tooting my own horn a bit, but I'm
so proud of that album. Most of the songs I wrote by myself. It didn't do very
well but I did it as a labor of love. I did not tour behind it because I'm not
really a solo artist. But before I leave this mortal coil I would love to do a
full-fledged tour. 

**WM:** There are multiple streaming services that play
many of your songs. What your viewpoint on streaming music?

> **SK:** It's
a sign of the times. The whole landscape of our industry has changed pretty dramatically
in the past twenty years with the advent of the internet. The only thing that
hasn't really been affected is live performances. There's still a huge demand
for live shows, thank goodness. But the record industry as you and I knew it is
pretty much gone. But with that said, I get a pleasant check every month for streaming
royalties from iTunes. 

**WM:** Your music has been on pretty much every format:
vinyl, reel-to-reel, 8-track, cassette, CD, digital files. What's your favorite
format? 

![image](/assets/img/interview_simon2.jpg)

> **SK:** We've been
on everything but the old vinyl 78 format, we're not THAT old! (laughs) That's
actually a very good question. Every generation has their own music format. When
I was a teenager it was 45s (records). When I was a little older it was cassettes.
I loved cassettes. You could throw twenty or thirty of them in your suitcase and
off you'd go. CD's came along and you could put a hundred of them in your backpack.
And now streaming. As I'm talking to you I could order the latest *Paul McCartney*
album and it will be on my iPhone in sixty seconds. It's unbelievable! But my
favorite is a sentimental choice of cassettes.

**WM:** Other than drums, what
other instruments do you play?

> **SK:** I play guitar, piano and bass. I
love them all. I've been playing guitar as long as I've been playing drums, which
is about fifty-five years. 

**WM:** Do you have a personal preference to any
band role?

> **SK:** I actually like singing lead. Don't get me wrong, I love
playing drums. When I'm done talking to you I'm going to a little studio and play
drums for an hour because I love playing percussion. But I did all the vocals
on my solo album and loved it. 

**WM:** Any plans in the future to do another
solo record? 

> **SK:** Well I have a bunch of songs and am under contract
with BMG to do another album. They are some really good songs! I'm going to be
seventy next year, and there has to come a time where touring is going to dissipate.
As much as I love playing to different people all over the world, I understand
those artists that hang it up eventually. It's not the playing, it's the traveling.
I'll always make music but I just can't take the travel much longer.

**WM:**
The show coming up at *the Resch Center* on October 27th is being put on by *Red
Rock Productions*. For all of their concerts they donate a portion of the proceeds
to different non-profit organizations. Are there any of these organizations that
you personally support or feel strongly about?

> **SK:** Oh yeah, the ones
that deal with addiction. I'm personally involved with two organizations that
helps kids and musicians with that. One is called *Right Turn* in *Massachusetts*.
The other is called *Road Recovery* which is down in *New York City* where I live.
We help kids deal with not only substance abuse but with depression, sexual abuse
â€¦ all the things that kids go through now days. Because I'm in recovery myself,
it helps me keep on the straight and narrow. 

**WM:** That's awesome! Some of
the organizations that will benefit from your *Green Bay* show are *the Red Cross*
and their efforts to provide relief to those affected by *Hurricane Florence*;
*the American Cancer Society*; *the Brown County Heroin Treatment Court*; and
*the Miracle League of the Lakeshore* that gives children with disabilities the
chance to play baseball. Do you see much of this in touring today, where some
of the profits are given back to the community? 

> **SK:** No, I don't. There's
the occasional show where that does happen. But by in large, the money normally
goes to places other than charity. But in a way, it should. Especially when it
comes to addiction, which is horrific. More people died from opioid overdoses
last year than were killed in Vietnam. And that's just from opioids like heroin.
Forget deaths by other substances. Addiction is terrible, but it is wonderful
that this company *Red Rock* is giving back like this. We are looking forward
to it!

You might not know the name Michael Licata, but you definitely know the
artists he's worked with -- from Chris Brown & Rihanna; to Blues Traveler
& Ricky Martin; and even Drake & Ringo Starr. As diverse as the artists
he's worked with, so are the different hats he's worn in the music industry: manager,
agent, drummer, writer, producer and even musical director. His current endeavor,
and possibly his most important to date, is a dual role with the exciting Femmes
of Rock. Early this year they played the Weidner Center, and this October they
will be back opening for Cheap Trick and Bad Company at the Resch Center. Michael
takes time out of his busy schedule to chat with Wisconsin Music about his past,
present and future.

![image](/assets/img/interview_mike2.jpg)

**WM:** You're
not only the manager of the Femmes of Rock, but you're also their drummer! When
did you first start playing drums?

> **ML:** I was eight years old. My dad
had a huge record collection, and I would grab pens or pencils and play along
to them. I just heard the beat. I never really focused on any other instrument
or vocals. It was all about the groove and the pocket for me, even as a kid. My
parents bought me a drum kit when I was ten and I never looked back. In high school
I played for the orchestra, the jazz band, the musicals and two different rock
bands. I just never stopped. 

**WM:** What were your musical influences? Things
your dad listened to or did you gravitate towards something on your own?

> **ML:** I was pretty open-minded to pop and rock as a kid. Growing up I played in
some Top 40 bands, but the defining moment in my life was hearing AC/DC. My style
is pretty much the same. Meat and potatoes, two and four, back beat, hard hitting
groove. I played the same hard-hitting style with Ricky Martin as I do now with
Femmes of Rock when we're playing Metallica. No nonsense!

**WM:** What do you
consider your first professional gig?

> **ML:** The first thing I ever did
that was on a national level was play over five years in a top 40 show band out
of Miami. We played five one-hour sets a night. That was when people used to actually
go out and see bandsâ€¦ not that I want to date myself! (laughs) But people would
come out five nights a week. That was like school for me. The first real GIG that
I had was with a pop singer named Jermaine Stewart. He had a hit in the late '80s
called "We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off", and I'm in the video for that.
You can't miss me, I'm the only white guy! I was his drummer and music director.
I saw the world with Jermaine and he was the greatest guy. We were the best of
friends until he passed away in 1997. So that got me in television and touring
around the world, and it took off from there. If you watch the video for that
song, you'll see for a horrifying moment me wearing this long trench coat. 

![image](/assets/img/interview_mike3.jpg)

**WM:**
Are the rumors true that you're going to be wearing that outfit in Green Bay during
the concert with Bad Company and Cheap Trick? (laughs)

> **ML:** I wouldâ€¦ but
I'm wearing it now! (more laughs) I actually have that coat in my closet. I'm
going to give it to my son someday. He'll probably disown me when he sees the
Duran Duran outfits his dad used to wear!

**WM:** You've played drums for a lot
of great talent, including Savage Garden and Ricky Martin. What was your favorite
gig, minus your current one with the Femmes of Rock? 

> **ML:** Man, that's
tough. Because this is, by far, my favorite gig. I get to play all my favorite
drummers! It's very challenging when you have a specific style, like I do, to
have Rush thrown at you. To try to do Neil Peart on a small drum set was rough.
It took me a month to learn Nina's crazy arrangement of seven Rush songs, but
I did it! 

> I get to drum the Who and Led Zeppelin every night, all my favorite
drummers. But it is challenging. Otherwise my second favorite gig was working
with Jermaine Stewart. That really was a band of brothers.

**WM:** In your impressive
career, any Spinal Tap moments?

> **ML:** There was some in every single band.
But early in my career in that Top 40 cover band we were playing live on television
in Montreal. It was for a telethon and they supplied the drum set. Both the kit
and the chair were very rickety. In the middle of one of the songs I leaned backwards
and fell off both the chair and the drum riser! I had to scramble to get back
up and continue to drum as if nothing happened. (laughs) 

**WM:** This October
27th you're returning to Green Bay, opening for Bad Company and Cheap Trick. Why
is this a dream concert for you?

> **ML:** That's easy. My four favorite bands
growing up were Kiss, Aerosmith, Cheap Trick and AC/DC. I've met members from
all those bands except for Cheap Trick. They are just legendary to me. When we
got the call to do this concert, I was over the moon. 

> We are going to
leave everything we've got on that stage. We want to be the band that had the
opening slot and won everybody over. That's our mission. 

![image](/assets/img/interview_mike4.jpg)

**WM:**
Things are moving fast for the Femmes of Rock! What's on the horizon?

> **ML:** In eighteen months with the Femmes of Rock, we are just on fire. Everyone is like-minded.
Nina and myself manage the band, and we have a great agent. We bleed on stage,
nobody is phoning it in. I don't see many bands out there anymore that are just
crushing it the way that we do. I don't mean to sound arrogant â€¦ that's just a
confidence thing. I'd pay to see this band because I like the music, I like the
arrangements and I like that everybody in the band is playing with real passion.
We're not trying to get a record deal; we just really enjoy what we're doing.

> So there are many things in the pipeline. We already have a few videos
and a EP that we sell at the shows, but there's plans for another EP and video.
We're going to keep pushing and we hope to take things to the next level in 2019.

The hit television show *"The Goldbergs"* is based on the childhood
family of producer *Adam Goldberg*. As the show gained in popularity, it was clear
that one of the main stars was the fictitious sister *Erica Goldberg*, played
by *Hayley Orrantia*. Anyone that has watched the show knows that not only is
Hayley a talented actress but an incredible singer as well! This Thursday Hayley
performs at *Backstage at the Meyer*, and she took some time out of her busy schedule
to talk with *Wisconsin Music*: 

![image](/assets/img/interview_hayley1.jpg)

**WM:**
What came first for you, singing or acting?

> **HO:** Definitely Singing. I've
been singing since I was thirteen years old. 

**WM:** You were on the very first
season of the *X-Factor*. Did your career take off from that or did you have other
irons in the fire? 

> **HO:** Everything started happening around the same
time, but they were all unrelated. When I started out in music I was told that
I should have a platform before they invested in me. So I spent years auditioning
before I did the *X-Factor*. I continued to audition after the show, and the first
thing I booked was The Goldbergs. 

**WM:** What instruments do you play? 

> **HO:** I play piano and I'm currently learning guitar.

**WM:** In the Goldbergs
you're immersed in 80's pop culture. Did the show turn you onto any songs or bands
from that era?

> **HO:** Actually there was an episode where we were performing
a *Rush* song, and we loved it! That was a lot of fun playing 'Tom Sawyer'. But
even before that I love *Whitney Houston*. 'The Greatest Love Of All' is one of
my favorite songs. 

![image](/assets/img/interview_hayley2.jpg)

**WM:**
It's clear that some of your personal traits are written in for Erica on the show.
How much input are you given with the character's arc?

> **HO:** I didn't think
that I would have any input at all. My character is based on Adam's real life
older brother Eric, but they decided they wanted another girl on the show. But
in season one I mentioned that I sing and if there ever was an opportunity I would
love to do it. They ended up working it into an episode with me singing at a talent
show. Since then they've been working in songs for me to sing, some from the eighties
and some original ones as well.

**WM:** You've released several singles and videos
including 'Strong, Sweet & Southern' and 'Love Sick'. Do you have any plans
on releasing a full length album at some point?

> **HO:** I'm not currently
on a label so I'll continue to release them like this for now on ITunes, Spotify
and YouTube. In the next few months I'll be releasing three more songs.

**WM:**
Will you be performing any of those songs Thursday night in *Green Bay*?

> **HO:** Yes, actually I'll be playing all three! 

**WM:** You starred in the recent
movie "God's Not Dead 2". Are there any movies planned for your future? 

> **HO:** Right now I'm so busy with the show *(The Goldbergs)* and my music. But
if the right thing comes along, maybe! 

**WM:** Anything to say to your fans
from Wisconsin?

> **HO:** I hope to see you at the show! *Brennly Brown* is
opening and she's an amazing singer. I can't wait to meet everybody!

Songs are written, recorded and released. Many are heard and forgotten.
Others strike a chord and stay around awhile. Then there are the rare few that
become a part of our culture, and *38 Special* songs are deep in the American
fabric. Songs such as 'Caught Up In You' and 'Hold On Loosely' are known by young
and old alike. Lead singer *Don Barnes* takes a break from recording and touring
to discuss their upcoming concert in *Green Bay* with *REO Speedwagon* ...

![image](/assets/img/interview_don2.jpg)

**WM:**
Great to talk with you Don. We are really excited for your show at the *Resch
Center* on March 11. 

> **DB:** We are too! We were approached about three
months ago for this show and it didn't really work out with our touring schedule.
Then I found out about all the charities that a part of the proceeds are going
to. And *REO Speedwagon* are old friends of ours. We all survived through the
eighties together. Great guys to hang out with and great songs. So it's going
to be a great show. We line up those hits and play them with as much conviction
and passion as we did the day we recorded them. If we went through the motions,
it would be boring! So we want to see people high-fiving each other and singing
along. It's a great job to bring that kind of joy to people, and also with the
charity organizations for this show as well. 

**WM:** Your songs have been radio
staples for decades. What's the oddest place you've heard one of them?

> **DB:** Well, of course there's bathrooms and restaurants and things like that.
But when I'm off the road I have a personal trainer that I go see. My real name
is Richard, and that's what I go by there. So for three years now he doesn't know
who I am and I'm sweating away as I do all his workout routines. There's always
music coming out of the speakers up in the ceiling, and sometimes our songs come
on. He's singing along to 'Hold On Loosely' while I'm picking up the dumbbells!
(laughs) It's a surreal moment. If he only knew! I don't say anything because
there's a lot of people in there and word would get around. I don't want them
watching me as I'm sitting on the ground sweating! (more laughs) 

**WM:** Let's
warp back to 1987. You leave *38 Special* and start working on a solo record that
never gets released until just recently. How did that come about? 

> **DB:** When I left the band our record label, A&M, offered me a solo album. So they
financed the whole thing and let me hand-pick the best players in the world. It
was all finished and mixed. Even the cover art was being worked on when A&M
was sold to PolyGram. The new staff coming in didn't have any emotional investment
so the record was shelfed. It was stuck in limbo and through the years, I was
always trying to get the rights to it. Finally, it was released through an Australian
label called Melodic Rock Records last year. Surprisingly, it's been getting five
stars on Amazon and other outlets across the world! But it really was a true long
lost record. 

![image](/assets/img/interview_don3.jpg)

**WM:** Did A&M
still have the masters tapes for it? 

> **DB:** No, they destroyed the masters!
You would have thought they would have been in a climate controlled vault somewhere.
So when I was approached about releasing it, we did three different searches for
the tapes but they were trashed. Now shortly after I recorded it, the engineer
handed me the final mix in a box with red lettering on it. I lost track of that
box through the years and now Melodic Rock wants to release it. So I checked up
in the attic and the basement, but I just couldn't find it. It turns out that
my son had it in his storage items in the bottom of a bin. I just about fainted!
And that's what they took to make the record.

**WM:** Your charity concert in
*Green Bay* also features *Warrant* and *REO Speedwagon*. Have you ever shared
a stage with either band before?

> **DB:** Yes, we've shared many stages with
*REO* through the years. We were the support act for the &lt;i&gt;Hi Infidelity&lt;/i&gt;
tour when they were the biggest band in the world back in the eighties. So we
are looking forward to it. Like I said, it wasn't in our plan to be doing this
with our tour schedule. But we found out about all the great charities involved
in this show and we had to do it!

**WM:** What's on the horizon for *38 Special*?

> **DB:** We just got back from the studio. We try to carve out some time between
touring, as we still do a hundred cities a year. We have some great songs we wrote
with *Jim Peterik* from the band *Survivor*. He wrote 'Eye Of The Tiger' and co-wrote
a lot of our hits through the years. So we should have something new out in the
fall of this year!

Warrant was one of the last hard rock bands to make it big before the
grunge movement of the early '90s. Some even accused Warrant of being the straw
that broke the back of hard rock, with tongue-in-cheek hits like 'Cherry Pie.'
As other bands called it quits, Warrant fought their way through the '90s, consistently
releasing albums and touring.



![image](/assets/img/interview_erik2.jpg)

In the 2000s, hard rock came back into the limelight. A fairy tale ending, yet
with a tragic twist for the Down Boys. Lead singer Jani Lane could not shake his
personal demons and passed away in 2011. For many bands, losing a main songwriter
and singer is the kiss of death. Warrant soldered on. Today, they are still putting
out strong albums, like last year's &lt;i&gt;Louder Harder Faster&lt;/i&gt;, and
hitting the stage hard. Founding member and guitar player Erik Turner talks to
Wisconsin Music about his life in music and Warrant's upcoming show at the Resch
Center on March 11th with REO Speedwagon and 38 Special: 

**WM:** How did you
first start playing the guitar?

> **ET:** I fell in love with the guitar with
the first two records I bought. I was eleven years old... Aerosmith's first album
and Alice Cooper's &lt;i&gt;Welcome To My Nightmare&lt;/i&gt;. So a couple years
later I'm completely obsessed with rock and roll and I started jamming in a garage
with some neighbors. They started showing me riffs like Led Zeppelin. I just kept
playing and learning until I was nineteen and then I moved out to LA. And that's
where we started Warrant in 1983. I was nineteen and everyone else in the band
was sixteen years old, so I was the old man in the band! (laughs) Here we are
today in 2018 and I'm still in the same band. Jerry (Dixon) and I were part of
the original five, and a couple years later Jani, Steven (Sweet) and Joey (Allen)
joined. That's the line-up that everybody knows, and I'm happy to say we still
have four out of five original members. 

**WM:** That's a long time with a guitar
in your hands! What was the first concert you ever attended?

> **ET:** My
step-brother took me to see Elton John at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles.
It was a great concert even though I was a hard rock fan. It was a magical night.
Years later we got to open for Elton at a big festival in Switzerland. 

![image](/assets/img/interview_erik1.jpg)


**WM:** What was the first rock concert you attended?

> **ET:** That's
a good one. It might have been Jefferson Starship at the same venue. I pretty
much saw every hard rock band that you can name while still in high school. Back
when concert tickets were eight or nine bucks! Tenth row for AC/DC on the &lt;i&gt;Back
in Black&lt;/i&gt; tour for nine bucks.

**WM:** What was the first rock star
that you ever met? 

> **ET:** It might have Ted Nugent at the Country Club.
We didn't have a record deal yet, but we were popular in the area so we got an
opening slot for Ted. He was really cool. Still is. We get to play with him every
now and again.

**WM:** You have quite the guitar collection. What's your favorite
one that you own? 

> **ET:** Man, it's hard to pick just one. I guess it would
have to be my 1969 Black Beauty Les Paul custom that I've played on a handful
of songs on each record we've ever made. Joey got it from our producer Beau Hill,
and I got it from Joey.

**WM:** Warrant is opening for REO Speedwagon and 38
Special this March 11th in Green Bay. This is a huge benefit concert for the Red
Cross hurricane and wildlife relief. Also, a portion of the proceeds from this
concert will benefit the Veterans' Mentor Group of Outagamie County the Jackie
Nitschke Center in Green Bay and the YWCA of Green Bay. Have you ever shared a
stage with either band before?

> **ET:** I'm not sure about 38 Special, but
we've played a couple times with REO. Great band, and I've gotten to play golf
with Kevin Cronin. Super nice guy! I was a fan long before I met him. &lt;i&gt;Nine
Lives&lt;/i&gt; is a great album. I bought it when still in high school. And they
are awesome live. 

**WM:** A few weeks ago was Jani Lane's birthday. If he were
still alive today, what would you say to him?

> **ET:** Keep on making music.
You have this amazing talent to sing and write songs. People don't realize how
hard it is to write a song that resonates in millions of people's hearts. So I
wish he was alive, writing songs, sober and in the band. That would be ideal.
But as you know, life's not always ideal. 

**WM:** You're not a bad songwriter
yourself! 

> **ET:** Not like Jani, but thank you.

![image](/assets/img/interview_erik3.jpg)


**WM:** Twenty years ago you self-released &lt;i&gt;Demos For Diehards&lt;/i&gt;,
featuring songs you co-wrote with Tommy Thayer (Kiss, Black 'N Blue). 

> **ET:** Yes, I only made 500 copies of that. I don't even think I have one! (laughs)

**WM:** A song on that album, 'Faraway Eyes', was sung by Jani Lane. I always
thought that could have been a big radio hit. Great writing, and Jani gave a great
performance of it. 

> **ET:** He sang his ass off on that song and also another
song on there called 'Don't Say Goodnight'. He came in, never really hearing them
previously, and killed it. It just blows my mind because I was there and I know
how it went down. He walked in, sang them a couple of times, and that's what you
hear. 

**WM:** Any chance of &lt;i&gt;Demos For Diehards&lt;/i&gt; being re-released?


> **ET:** Nah. People have posted it on YouTube and all the file sharing
sites. So it's out there. The album cover is a picture of a painting I did back
when I used to do art.

**WM:** Do you still paint?

> **ET:** No, I lost
the inspiration to paint a long time ago. 1996 was probably the last time I did
a painting.

**WM:** Last year Warrant released &lt;i&gt;Louder Faster Harder&lt;/i&gt;,
which was produced by Jeff Pilson (Dokken, Foreigner.) How was it working with
him? 

> **ET:** It was great working with Jeff. It takes us forever to write
a record, but once we get that out of the way we have a lot of fun in the studio.
This record is a little old school, blues-based hard rock. It's not overly polished
and produced. We're really proud of it. We'll play one song off it there in Green
Bay. When we're doing an opening set like that, people want to hear all the hits.


**WM:** We're looking forward to your concert at the Resch Center on March
11th!

> **ET:** We are too, it's going to be a big party. If you're reading
this, you're invited to the show! Leave all the politics at home and all the other
crap going on in the world and come help support a good cause. Who knows, maybe
you'll even meet your future ex-wife! (laughs)

While the violin is closely associated with country music, it's rarely
linked to Rock & Roll. The Femmes of Rock are looking to change that with
their high-powered violin covers of classic rock music. Founder and arranger Nina
DiGregorio took some time to talk to Wisconsin Music about their upcoming performance
at the Weidner Center:

![image](/assets/img/interview_for2.jpg)

**WM:**
When did you first start playing violin?

> **ND:** I first started playing
violin by accident. When I was nine years old and in fourth grade, they had us
pick what instruments we wanted to play. At the time The Simpsons was a really
popular cartoon. I was also really into 1950's rock music, like old school rock
& roll prior to the Beatles. So I picked the saxophone. The band director
then called me in and said that I was really small and he didn't think I would
be able to carry the saxophone to and from the bus every day. He suggested I try
the violin because it was a lot lighter. That's honestly how it started! It didn't
start with a fiery passion for the violin. Someone suggested it to me and I said
yes. 

**WM:** Have you ever had a chance to talk to that band director now that
your career is onstage with a violin? 

> **ND:** No, I haven't. I actually
do keep in contact with the orchestra director that I ended up learning from.
But not the band director that taught saxophone, I don't even know what happened
to him. I wonder if he ever hears this story and thinks 'Huh, I'm glad I started
that!'

**WM:** All these classic rock songs you perform would sound a little
different if you played them on the saxophone! (laughs)

> **ND:** Definitely!


**WM:** What are some of your influences?

> **ND:** It all started with
1950's music. My father and his friend were really into that music and I remember
him taking my mom to sock-hops when I was little. Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard,
and Elvis. I was able to go to Graceland about two years ago and it was a spine-tingling,
chilling emotional experience. I was a big fan of the Drifters from the early
sixties. The song 'Up On The Roof' was my favorite song for probably the first
ten years of my life. But that kind of music was going on in my house, and I just
loved it. I listened to that for a long time until I hit about eleven years old
and I discovered the Beatles. That changed everything for me. Obviously I am too
young to have ever seen the Beatles themselves, but there was a cover group that
came to the college my mom worked at. She took me and my best friend to the show
and we were just completely in awe of the music. It started a ten year love affair
with the Beatles where I collected every album, every book that I could read about
them, every movie that they made. It was super Beatlemania all over again in the
early nineties. From there I got turned onto Led Zeppelin, the Doors, Chicago,
Pink Floyd, and AC/DC.

![image](/assets/img/interview_for3.jpg) 

**WM:**
How did you come up with the idea to marry your violin playing with classic rock?

> **ND:** That also started when I was quite young... when I was nine or ten
and had my little rental violin and would do my practicing after school. My mom
was a casual piano player, nothing professional. My father had an acoustic guitar
- he also was a casual player. He had a book of Beatles music that had guitar
chords and melody lines. While my mom would cook dinner, my dad would strum the
chorus and I would play the melody. And that's really the first time that I started
playing the violin in that manner. From there I had a classical career that spans
all the way to my master's degree, and I would play in orchestras. But that part
of me that wanted to perform this kind of music stayed with me the entire time
that I was studying. And now we have a quartet of girls that performs with full
effect pedals just like guitar players.

**WM:** You are paired with Lita Ford
for your show at the Weidner Center. Have you shared a stage with her previously?


> **ND:** This is our very first booking with Lita, and we're big fans. We
are really excited about this 'women that rock' theme. We hope that this is the
first show of a much larger tour that happens. Red Rock Productions is the promoter
that is putting this on and bringing us all together. I know that part of the
proceeds of the show are going to the YWCA and some other women's groups. So the
cause is really important to the show as much as the rock and roll that we'll
play. 

**WM:** In doing some research today I see that you know your drummer
Michael extremely well. In fact, you're married to him! How did the two of you
meet?

> **ND:** Now this is a funny story! We both grew up about 15 minutes
away from each other in suburbs of Buffalo, New York. He moved to Los Angeles
to pursue his music and management career. I moved to Las Vegas performing with
Wayne Newton. About eight years ago I was performing in a lounge, I actually played
bass guitar for this band. He was visiting from LA and came into the lounge I
was playing in. Our drummer in this band was also from Buffalo and he introduced
the two of us. We kept in touch over the years, but we had significant others
at the time. It was about five years ago now that we were both single and in Buffalo
for Christmas. We went to see a band play together, and have been together ever
since! So basically we both moved about three thousand miles away from home to
end up with somebody from our home town and that's also a musician!

**WM:**
Have you ever been to Green Bay previously? 

> **ND:** We performed in Wisconsin,
but not Green Bay so this will be our first time.

**WM:** Hopefully the cold
isn't too cold for you.

> **ND:** My wheelhouse is about twenty-five degrees
and about eight feet of snow, growing up in Buffalo. But I'm no good with negative
ten!

**WM:** How long have you lived in Las Vegas?

> **ND:** I've been in
Las Vegas about thirteen years. Everyone says that after you've lived in Las Vegas
for seven years you get acclimated to the climate, but I definitely prefer the
snow to the heat! 

**WM:** Well, hopefully our temperature stays decent for
when you perform!

> **ND:** We're looking forward to it!

You cannot turn on the radio during the holidays without hearing a song
by Trans Siberian Orchestra. They've become as much a part of Christmas tradition
as eggnog and mistletoe!

Guitarist and musical director Al Pitrelli has been
with them from the beginning, and recently sat down with Wisconsin Music to discuss
his Christmas Past, Present and Future: 

![image](/assets/img/interview_2016-12-02-al-pitrelli-01.jpg)

**WM:**
How have the shows been so far on this tour?

> **AP:** So far, so amazing.
Things have been going great this year.

**WM:** Let's start by visiting with
your past. When did you first start playing guitar?

> **AP:** I first had a
guitar in my hands in 1964. I was two years old and I had just watched the Beatles
on Ed Sullivan. And that was it, I was hooked. For a lot of people of my generation,
that was a life-changing evening, watching that on Ed Sullivan. My mom has told
the story a thousand times! The story goes that I was glued to the tv, and my
grandfather had a guitar in the corner of the living room. I would watch the Beatles
do their thing and then I would run over to the guitar and start strumming. From
that moment on, I would just drag the thing around with me and make noise with
it. It wasn't anything musical, but definitely this was my new best friend. So
not too long after that, when I was four or five years old, I started getting
guitar lessons from a local teacher in town. Then, going through the public school
system in the '60s, there were a lot of music courses. 

**WM:** Other than your
grandfather, does anybody else in your family have musical abilities?

> **AP:** Nahâ€¦ they couldn't even play the radio. (laughs) It was a white, middle-class,
go to church, everybody works kind of family. There was nothing musical going
on, there wasn't even a piano in the house. They wanted nothing to do with it,
and that almost inspired me more to seek out this thing that everybody was not
that into. But my grandfather's guitar, I' E kept it all these years. 

**WM:**
What was the first concert you attended?

> **AP:** The Temptations at the Westbury
Music Fair in 1968. That I remember like it was yesterday. Motown man, that was
it. The Temptations, Glady Knight, Marvin Gaye, Diana Rossâ€¦ Motown was dominating
the charts on the AM radio. My aunt and my uncle were in their early twenties
and they were very into music, and they ended up taking me and I just loved it
to death. I thought the Temptations were the coolest thing ever.

**WM:** I became
familiar with you as a guitar player when you started playing with Alice Cooper
in the late '80s, but I was surprised to see some of the different bands you placed
with and some of the things you played on. 

> **AP:** Me too! (laughs)

**WM:**
What do you consider your first big break?

> **AP:** The first thing that I
did -- that was for real -- was in the mid-'80s. I was teaching a lot and a lot
of people knew that I was well-versed in a lot of different styles of music. 

So
I got a phone call by a buddy of mine who was an engineer at a studio in New York
City. They were doing a record and they wanted a guitar solo in the manner of
Steve Lukather from Toto. I didn't even ask who it was or how much it was, I just
said "I'll be right there!" I was just excited to go play on something. 

It
turned out to be Phillip Michael Thomas from that tv show Miami Vice. The other
guy from the show had a pretty big hit on the radio (Don Johnson â€“ "Heartbeat"),
so I guess he figured he could do the same thing. It was being produced by the
guys in Kool In The Gang. The best part of that record was that it was voted as
one of the top five worst records by Billboard magazine! I was so proud. (laughs)

**WM:**
You really gained some notoriety when you played for Alice Cooper. Do you have
a favorite memory from that time?

> **AP:** A thousand memories. It was my
first real big rodeo and I was hired as the musical director. Which meant that
I got to run the band, work on arrangements and come up with ideas. Aside from
getting a great education -- and Alice being such a great teacher at getting me
ready for what I didn't know was to come... 

One of the things that that stands
out was that we had to go find the original recording voice-over that Vincent
Price did for Alice's song "I Love The Dead" from 'Welcome To My Nightmare.'
Nobody had that voice-over so we actually went to A&M studios, got the original
two inch tape that the band originally recorded on all those years ago with Bob
Ezrin. I had the tapes in my hand, put them on the reel to reel and put the faders
up. Talk about going back in time! It was in '73 or '74 and here I am in 1989
listening to the original tapes. That was pretty exciting to be a part of that
history. 

The thing with Alice is that was the first time anybody interpreted
rock music with a theatrical presentation. When we did 'The Ballad of Dwight Fry',
he would dress up in the strait jacket and he became that character. Unbeknownst
to me at the time, I would be living that the rest of my live with TSO, because
that is basically what we are. 

**WM:** When you first became involved in TSO,
did you have any idea how huge it would become?

> **AP:** No. I was convinced
it was a beautiful piece of art that I helped create. When you think about 1995,
there was nothing like that going on musically. It had Christmas themes. It was
recorded as a part soundtrack to underscore a very dark story about the war in
Yugoslavia for the band Savatage. Paul [O'Neill - TSO founding member] had written
this rock opera called "Dead Winter Dead" and I was thrilled to work with him.
As soon as I finished that session, I thought that was the end of it. Who would
have ever thought in a million years that it would have become the number one
requested song in America? 

And even at that point when it was all over the place,
I thought 'Well, that was a lot of fun for a minute.' You're talking twenty-one
years ago, from the moment I recorded those first notes, to you and I having this
conversation right now. 

**WM:** It's amazing how broad your audience is at the
concerts. You have small children to old ladies getting into it. It's unbelievable!

> **AP:** You're 100% correct. And I know that's factual and not marketing because
my mother, who's seventy-five years old, loves this stuff. Maybe because it's
her son playing it, but you can only listen to it once or twice if that's the
case. She didn't listen to the Megadeth stuff I did! (laughs)

**WM:** What's
your preference: recording in the studio or playing live?

> **AP:** Both. I
get equally antsy if I've done one for too long. I'm ok with both sides of the
fence, I'm very fortunate that way. I love creating and recording but I also love
seeing the reaction from the audience.

**WM:** Would you ever put out a solo
album?

> **AP:** Nah. This is my solo project. It varies enough musically to
keep me on my toes all the time. If you asked me that question thirty years ago,
sure. But now it's full time and I'm also trying to find a balance between this
and my family.

**WM:** TSO has become a Christmas tradition so I hope you don't
retire anytime soon!

> **AP:** I can't afford to retire, I have kids to put
through college. (laughs) And I'm having too much fun! I would rather die than
not do this. I have no intentions of walking away. 

**WM:** What is on the horizon
for TSO after this tour?

> **AP:** There's a couple of rock operas in the works.
I would like to get those done this spring into the summer. Then start getting
ready for next year's winter tour again. It takes about four or five months to
get the crew up and running with the new production ideas and new special effects.
And then we're back on the road for 2017!

Some artists
refuse to be pigeon-holed, and Troy Luccketta is one of those artists. Most know
him as the drummer for classic hard rock band Tesla. But he also has his hands
in country, classical, and Christian music. Wisconsin Music catches up with this
busy entertainer:

*WM*: What can you tell me about the new Tesla live release?


> **TL:** Well, I can tell you that last year when we were on tour with Def
Leppard, towards the end of that run, Phil Collins (Def Leppard's guitarist) had
suggested that we put out a live record of our first album since it's coming up
on the 30th anniversary of its release. So we just jumped right in. From what
I remember we only had a had a few weeks of the tour left. What we would do was
that we'd open the show with a couple different songs from the first album each
night. I haven't heard it, but Phil tells me it's great. In the midst of all that,
Phil had written and produced a new bonus Tesla song for that record as well.


*WM*: When you first joined Tesla, did you have any idea how well received
this band would be?

> **TL:** Quite honestly, I did. From the time that I
joined them, I knew in my heart of hearts that we were going to do what we did.
Now, with that being saidâ€¦ that meant that we're going to make a record, do some
tours, and things are going to go well. I never saw that we'd still be here 30
years later! But I really believed with what we were doing that we would get a
shot and do what we did. 

*WM*: What's it's like having Phil produce your
new record? How hands-on is he? 

> **TL:** He is 100% hands-on. He's been
the guy to put things in perspective. He's had a hand in the writing and he works
with everybody individually. I went in and recorded all the drums with him and
an engineer. He's like a little junior Mutt Lange! (laughs) He comes from that
school. He gets it and knows what's going on. He makes no bones about what needs
to be done and how we need to do it. We've let go 100% and we're trusting him.
He's deserving of it and he's proven himself with what he's done so far. It's
working very nicely.

*WM*: I like that comment about being a Junior Mutt Lange!
So his production style is like Mutt, or the way he approaches things?

> **TL:** The way he approaches things. I think he has a bit more organic approach
with us because of who we are and how we do things. But nevertheless, it's the
mentality behind it. No wasted parts, no wasted solos, and if you can't sing it
or hum itâ€¦ don't bother to play it. All hooks-based, and it's working. It's really
exciting.

*WM*: The past few Tesla releases have been on your own label, Tesla
Electric Company Recordings. Will the new studio release be on that label as well?

> **TL:** It is. It will be distributed by Mailboat in the US, and probably
Frontiers overseas. 

*WM*: Is there a tentative date for this release?

> **TL:** Early 2017, that's all I know.

*WM*: That's awesome, I can't wait to
hear it. Now we're going to shift gears a little bit. You're a man of faith, and
you make no bones about it. How long have you been a Christian?

> **TL:** Well, probably the late '80s. If I remember correctly, we were going to film 'Hang
Tough.' We were on a flight and flying into Los Angeles, and I sat next to a couple
on the plane. They were an older Christian couple. We got to talking about God
and they had my attention. I never really thought about what it was to be a Christian.
I was still doing drugs at the time â€¦ I was not sober. But they said if I wanted
to accept Christ, to give them a call. They gave me their number, and I called
them either that night or the next night. They came to my hotel, and I accepted
Christ there in my room. 

I've got to be honest with you -- I could have went
out and partied that next day. I don't know if I took it any further than accepting
Christ, it was a very non-proactive road at that time. But when the band broke
up in '96, I would come to be more involved. This guy that I knew was making these
children's Christian records in my studio. He invited me to his church, and that's
when it really took hold. 

I got sober in late '91. I was sober for a few years
and then relapsed, so now my sober date is now the 4th of July '93. So now I'm
23 years sober. Looking back at how things happened, I'm not sure if it stuck
when I accepted Christ that first time with that couple. I probably accepted Christ
another 10 times after that! (laughs) So I am a bit of a Jesus Freak today. I
love the Lord. It's such a beautiful, peaceful place to be. Especially in a world
of chaos. I have a sense of peace today through that relationship in Christ.

*WM*: Have you kept in contact with that couple? 

> **TL:** No. If they
reached out to me today, that would be so wonderful to hear from them.

*WM*:
Tell me a little bit about your wife Linda. How did you two meet?

> **TL:** We met through my childhood friend Rick that was married to her sister Debbie.
About 4 years ago, Debbie had gotten sick with colon cancer. I was playing a benefit
to help out, and her sister Lisa was there. We became friends and have been together
since. She was trying to help her sister out and I was trying to help my friend
out. Her sister didn't want to do the chemo or radiation, she was trying to treat
it holistically. My friend was trying to put the information together but he couldn't
get the information fast enough or understand where we needed to be. That being
said, we started a foundation called "A Song 4 Wellness":http://www.songforwellness.org/
in memory of her sister. It's an awareness site about pH, alkalinity, nutrition,
and how disease cannot survive in an alkaline body. I believe if we would have
had that information at the time that she would be alive today. He sacrifice,
just like Jesus on the cross, has given us purpose. So my wife works on that website
every day... she just finished up a section on proteins. We've learned a lot.
We are very humbled by everything that we do. So we're just sharing what we're
learning and whatever we can share to make people aware of what we are doing and
give them information to make healthier decisions.

*WM*: Let's talk a little bit about some of your side projects, starting with
Whitford St. Holmes.

> **TL:** I did the record with them last year and then
I went out last November and did about ten shows. Brent Fitz, Slash's drummer
for the last five years, is out on tour with them now. We might be doing another
record. That whole first record was really an accident, in my eyes. I did a couple
of jams with them and then they asked me to go into the studio with them. I thought
it was just some stuff I was putting down for demos, but it turned out to be the
record. And it's all live. Guitars, bass, drumsâ€¦ and then they put vocals and
keyboards on it.

*WM*: You had a project a couple of years ago, Cadillac Drive,
that I thought had a lot of potential. I couldn't believe that some label didn't
snatch that up, those tracks were incredible. It was a great blend of country
and rock. Did anything ever happen with that?

> **TL:** I'm so glad you're
asking about that. It's now changed to Dixie Horsepower, and that record will
be done by the end of the year. We realized there's something really great there,
I'm glad you recognize that as we do.

*WM*: Also a couple of years ago you
were the driving force behind a big benefit concert for the Station Family Fund
and VH1 recorded and aired it. What was the end results of that concert, and what's
the status of it?

> **TL:** It's funny you would mention that because I was
just with them. I have a dozen friends that are like my second family through
that. The fund itself is no longer. They're all trying move forward and put their
lives together. There is a memorial being built on the club property, and I know
they're not too far away from that being finished. The concert did provide a lot
of TV and financial support. We raised six hundred and fifty thousand dollars
with that event. It just goes to show that, with a little faith, what can happen
and how many lives can be changed as a direct result of that.

*WM*: That was
great to see VH1 run with it. That took the awareness to a whole new level. 

> **TL:** Yeah, and God bless Dee Snider for that. He brought them on board.

*WM*:
I know you recorded with the Three Fates Project a few years ago with Keith Emerson,
whom passed away earlier this year. Were you still in contact with Keith?

> **TL:** Yes, there were eight sold out shows in Japan that I was supposed to go
out and play on this year with him. He passed away a week before our rehearsals
for that. I was a part of the tribute concert for him in May. It was filmed for
a documentary that will be coming out. 

*WM*: There was previously a Tesla
box set in the works. What ever happened with that?

> **TL:** Due to some legality,
it hasn't had a chance to come together. But I can tell you that Telsa is now
signed with HK Management, they also manage Def Leppard, Aerosmith and a bunch
of big bands. We're very excited to be with them now so that's providing some
new opportunities. 

There's no chance of us slowing down. It's such a forward
momentum with the band. We are somewhat being re-invented. Everything from the
food we eat, to the clothes we wear, and the music we play. We're excited about
that, so stay tuned!

There are several hard rock bands in the 80's that had commercial success
early on before the flood of bands that followed them: Quiet Riot, Twisted Sister,
Motley Crue, and Ratt. These bands are still out there today in one form or another,
the most recent semi-reunion belonging to Ratt. Sure, there's been a band touring
for the past several years under the Ratt moniker, but it wasn't until this year
that lead singer Stephen Pearcy returned to the foldâ€¦ or cellar. Stephan takes
time from their successful summer tour with Poison to talk with Wisconsin Music
about being back for more:

**WM:** How have the shows been so far on this tour?

> **SP:** Pretty good. We're touring with Poison until September 3rd, and then we'll
start a solo tour. We'll do a few shows here and there before we leave for Japan
and other places. That should take care of this year, and then we'll hopefully
get busy on some new music. But we're out and about, and ready to piss people
off again!

**WM:** Ratt just released a DVD of all your old videos, and a new
best of CD will be released at the end of the month. How much input did you have
on these releases? 

> **SP:** Quite a lot. Warren and I did the sequencing
on the CD and picked the songs collectively with the guys. The DVD we narrated,
and we also put some videos on there that were never really shown or released.
They're collectively all together for the first time. The long form videos back
in the day went platinum and gold respectively, but there still were some videos
that weren't released. So now you have them all. We're really happy about the
DVD, it's about time.

**WM:** You mentioned new music, what can you tell us about
that?

> **SP:** Warren and I have been writing as much as we can around the
tour. It's coming along. We've got some great ideas, and we have our format. We're
going back to basics and we'll see what it brings. When we have some time off
we'll get in the studio, deliver the goods and lay it down!

**WM:** How is it
working with Warren again after all these years?

> **SP:** It's no different
than it was before. We're just a little smarter and there's less of the band things
to disturb the good things. 

**WM:** There's a couple of trends right now with
your peers where they will either release their old demos or record a bunch of
cover tunes. So from what you're saying, fans can expect all new material from
Ratt? 

> **SP:** Yeah, it's time for something new. We're gonna finish the
job we started. Ratt's the type of band that takes care of business, but we know
didn't finish the job. All the stuff that we had with Robin, then the band disbanding,
then the legal, etc. So right now there's a lot of catching up to do and a lot
of things to take care of.

**WM:** Do you have any label interest for the new
CD?

> **SP:** We're on Rhino right now. I'm sure we wouldn't have a problem
with them for a label. I mean I have a label myself, and I'd rather us go independently
than major. But like I said, we're on Rhino for the 'best of' CD and the DVD.
We'll see what happens. It's a whole new world out there nowadays; it's not all
about record stores anymore. The big labels are now headed towards the one big
conglomerate monster. I like the fact that my label is independent. I'm not concerned
about a finding a home for the new CD. My concern is getting the right place to
do it. We're writing very well right now. If we get the right climate and surroundings,
it will be very easy to accomplish.

**WM:** Will the lyrics be classic Ratt 'n
Roll material?

> **SP:** I couldn't tell ya, because I write with whatever
suites me at that moment. I've always been a writer about what I live, see and
breathe. It's not fantasy and Dungeons and Dragons, or politics. It's about having
a good time or fuckin' kicking ass... or just fucking! (laughs) 

**WM:** What
are some of the differences to being on the road now as opposed to back in the
day?

> **SP:** There are none. It's just what door do you want to go through:
A, B or C. When you open the door there's a surprise or your prize. Nothing's
changed; it's just that everyone's a little more alert or aware. For most of us
there's change, I mean I have an 11 year old daughter now. But as far as rock
'n roll, it's all still there. I'm still the party director!

**WM:** So you're
back in your element, but now you have an 11 year old daughter. Has that changed
your outlook on all things rock 'n roll?

> **SP:** It changes everything! It's
payback. (laughs) I took her out on stage recently, and showed her all the goofy
people I yell at every night. She wants to do it again; I think I created a monster.
Some things change, but the song remains the same! (more laughs)

**WM:** Before
the reunion you were working on a book titled RaTTails. What's the status of the
book?

> **SP:** Still working on it. We now have closure. The final chapter
of this book is this tour. Who knows, maybe it isn't the end of everything. But
it's quite full ofâ€¦. Forget dirt (reference to Motley Crue's book 'The Dirt'),
it's mud! And I've got photos to back all of it. It's quite an experience. It's
not just about the rock 'n roll world. It's about somebody who was into something,
me into racing, who got introduced to something else. It takes you into that whole
trip, but yet it's sincere. The book's been 4 years in the making. It'll be an
interesting read!

**WM:** If you could pick one song you love to play live, what
would it be?

> **SP:** Body Talk. It reminds me of when things were all or
nothing. We've been there, done that. We're all jaded. Every night I have to find
ways to entertain myself, but I manage!

**WM:** Any message to your fans in Wisconsin?

> **SP:** Past, present, and future Ratt 'n Rollers, thank you very much. The party's
still here, let the games begin!

Music and the decades they came from can, for the most part, be catorigized.
In the 70's you had disco, bell bottoms and flower power. In the 80's you had
arena rock, spandex costumes, and big hair. In the 90's you had grunge, flannel,
and anti-rock stars. Obviously there will always be exceptions, and the band Tesla
is definitely an exception. They came from the 80's, yet they lacked the spandex
and aqua net. They are the working man's band, with lyrics that were relatable
and songs that are memorable. Currently out on the road supporting their current
release Reel To Reel, drummer Troy Luccketta talks with Wisconsin Music about
his life, his faith, and his music: 

**WM:** How have the shows been so far on
this tour?

> **TL:** The shows have been good! There's a good buzz on the record,
which is nice. Now we're just out here working it. We just got back from Europe.
Did a few dates out there, and we're gonna go back again. So it seems like we're
off to a pretty good start.

**WM:** How is the response different in Europe compared
to the states?

> **TL:** I really don't know if it's fair to judge, because
we haven't been over there in 15 years. The response was great. The audiences
over there were pretty crazy and loud! Audiences here are great and really into
it too, but it seems like something was definitely happening over there. Looks
like we're going to open those markets back up.

**WM:** How did you get started
in music?

> **TL:** It goes back to my childhood. My mom records, my dad's
records, my brothers and sisters recordsâ€¦ which helped me realized I wanted to
play drums. Then I walked into this friend of mine's house one day, and he had
a snare drum there. They didn't have any sticks, and I remember us just standing
around looking at it. There were about 3 of us, and they knew I wanted to play.
I just grabbed some spoons and I played Wipeout. It's funny, because I can take
myself right back to that moment where it all started. At that point I didn't
have drums and I didn't have a lot of money. So I started working a paper route
and started saving my money to buy my first set of drums. I think it was 6th grade
at a talent show where me and a friend of mine played a couple of songs. Then
I started getting into cover bands. I was in a band when I was 15, and everyone
was olderâ€¦ early 20's. My first record was in 1982 with Eric Martin, the singer
from Mr. Big. And I've been doing it ever since.

**WM:** So how did you hook
up with Tesla?

> **TL:** The Eric Martin band was breaking up, and they (Tesla)
were looking for a drummer. They were called City Kid at the time, and there was
producer by the name of Dwayne Hitchens who was working with them. So he came
over and played me a couple of songs. I heard Jeff's voice and thought it was
interesting. He definitely had something different going on. I went down to this
club called the Oasis Ballroom a few nights in a row to check them out. Once I
started watching Jeff, I was sold. That's really what made the decision for me,
because he kept my attention the whole night.

**WM:** Was there ever any discussion
back then to conform to the look of other rock bands in that era?

> **TL:** Only with the record company when we did the first video. It was never something
that was consciously addressed. We were just playing music. So when you do videos,
they have budgets and they bring in their wardrobe people. They wheeled in all
these clothes. And all the clothes on these racks were spandex. (laughs) Serious,
this is a true story! There were just racks and racks full of spandex clothes.
And we were just looking and chuckling at each other.

**WM:** That look doesn't
really mesh with a "Modern Day Cowboy"!

> **TL:** (more laughs) Yeah, you
can tell they got to us a little bit with the hair spray. A little puffy hair
and a little eye-liner. That was their doing, it wasn't ours. But jumping into
spandex wasn't gonna happen!

**WM:** So tell us about the new album Reel To Reel.

> **TL:** Wellâ€¦

**WM:** It's a covers albumâ€¦

> **TL:** Umâ€¦ yep. Thanks for the
update. (laughs) There's 25 songs total. One disc you actually buy in the stores,
and there's another disc with 12 songs on it that you get when you buy a ticket
to a show. We didn't plan on recording that many songs, it's just something that
happened. We wanted live solos, playing together in a room, to 2 inch tape with
no Pro-tools. Keeping it honest and just having some fun! While we were doing
that in the first week we had 10 songs done. Three weeks later we had 25 songs
done. It was really only supposed to be one disc. From my understanding, I think
we're going to do a full release of both discs in October. That's because we're
going to be playing in cities that some people can't get to, so they might not
be able to get the second cd. We also started our own label; Tesla Electric Recordings...

**WM:**
Do you see future releases being on your new label?

> **TL:** Yeah, we're gonna
do a new studio album and put it out on there. I mean, for a band like usâ€¦ we
don't know if we'll ever be back to selling millions of records. And unless we
are, there's really no way to fully go after those markets. It makes more sense
financially to put them out ourselves. At least we'll be in control of where the
money's being spent, and how we're spending it.

**WM:** Who came up with the
concept of the CD and the packaging for Reel To Reel?

> **TL:** This is what
I remember: When we started discussing the recording being in analog, I suggested
we shoot a picture of a two inch tape machine. The rewind button would be lit
up on it, and the album would be called 'Rewind' because all these songs are from
the 70's. Our manager at the time, Tom Zutaut, spearheaded a lot of great ideas
and worked really hard. He put a lot of the concepts together, and just took the
ball and ran with it.

**WM:** The sound on Reel To Reel is back to the classic
Tesla sound where the previous release Into The Now was more modern in sound and
recording process. What direction do you see the next studio album taking?

> **TL:** I think it will be a hybrid of embracing both technologies. But who knows,
maybe we'll stick to recording analog.

**WM:** I think it sounds great. It comes
off very raw, which suits the material you're playing.

> **TL:** It really
does. It's got a great energy and vibe to it. It just seems like everything lined
up on this recording. I really feel like we hit a home run with it. It wasn't
over thought, and everything was recorded in a couple of takes. With the packaging,
the concept, and the soundâ€¦ everything just fell into place.

**WM:** Not only
is this the first release on your own label, it's also your first release without
the original line-up. In the past guitar player Tommy Skeoch has taken time off
from the band. Is this temporary or permanent this time?

> **TL:** Yes, it's
permanent. That's what was really cool about doing this cover album. It took the
pressure off, and we were able to go in and enjoy ourselves. There's definitely
a vibe with our new guy Dave. We haven't done any writing with him yet, but based
on what we've done with him so far it's been nice. It's been very effortless and
non-pretentious.

**WM:** In doing the research for this interview, I've discovered
you're a man of faith. How does that come into play as the drummer in Tesla?

> **TL:** Well, my faith is very strong. I'm a full blown Christian. I love the lord,
and I get it. That's my thing. I'm not standing out on a street corner (witnessing),
but I don't worry about who I offend with it either. It's attraction, not promotion.
I have my own set of morals and ethics that I live by, but that doesn't mean that
it's the same as yours.

> But am I gonna be in a band that's trashy and
do a bunch of trashy things? No, I'm not. Can I go play on somebody's record that
might not share the same values and maybe their coming from a different angle?
Depends on what it is. If it crosses the line? Then no. That's something that
I usually work out with myself, maybe through prayer. But as far as Tesla goes,
it all fits. Today there's no drugs or alcohol in this group. That's not from
me, that came from them. I would have never thrown that on them. But I've been
clean and sober for 14 years. I'm just doing my life, I'm not doing their life.
It's tough enough to keep my own life in check. But my faith definitely effects
my decisions and how I live.

> I just finished working on my first Christian
album for "Brandon Reid Allen":http://www.brandonreidallen.com/. It's kind of
like a Mellencamp type record, but mainstream Christian. If I play on someone's
record or if I do something, that's fine. But Tesla is truly where my heart is.

**WM:**
The organization that you started, Wake Up To Love, has had a very positive effect
on the lives of so many people. A couple of years ago you put on a benefit concert
for the Station Family Fund. Are there any future plans with Wake Up To Love?

> **TL:** It's funny you mention it, I just talked to them a couple of days ago. We're
gonna do another Station Family Fund show again this February. Your site can be
the first to announce that. It'll be interesting to see what comes from it. But
Tesla will be on the bill again.

**WM:** What's next for Tesla after the tour?

> **TL:** We're got a box set that's going to be coming out. It'll have early demos
and recordings, like Little Suzi with Ronnie Montrose producing. We were trying
to release it December of this year, but I can tell you it's not gonna happen
until next year. We're reviewing so much stuff. There's a ton of it, so we just
have to figure out how we're going to put it all together.

**WM:** Any message
to your fans in Wisconsin?

> **TL:** Well, our fans in Wisconsin have been
incredible over the years. Wisconsin has been one of those markets where we've
always looked forward to going back to because we've done so well there over the
years. We're gonna continue to make records, and we're gonna continue coming to
Wisconsin. I have nothing but a big THANKS.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the debut album from the glam
slam kings of noise: Poison. Teaming up with Cinderealla again this year, whom
also is celebrating the 20th anniversary of their album debut, this summer tour
will be more like a nation-wide celebration. Wisconsin Music recently chatted
with Poison bass player Bobby Dall, on everything from the new greatest hits CD
to his love for Flavor Flav.

**WM:** Hi Bobby. Did you have a show last night?

> **BD:** Yeah we did. It went fantastic. It was our first one. There's always a few
rough edges to work out, but it was fantastic. I apologize up front, I'm a little
hoarse and sore from it. It was a great show, we had a great time. It was in Mankato,
Minnesota. We've opened up a tour or two there now, and it's always a fun little
city to start in.

**WM:** I don't even recognize your voice, you must have been
screaming your head off last nightâ€¦

> **BD:** Yes. It's the beginning of the
tour, and I always blow my throat out. It comes back every night when I start
singing. This is my voice for the summer when we tour.

**WM:** You could play
some funny jokes on your friends with that voice.

> **BD:** My girlfriend's
always calling it 'the sexy voice'.

**WM:** Your 900 number voice! (laughs)

> **BD:** Exactly! (laughs) Which you're probably not interested in. But she looks
forward to the after-show call. (more laughs)

**WM:** So let's go back to the
beginning; how did you first start playing bass?

> **BD:** Honestly, I'm a
guitar player first. I started playing guitar when I was a teenager. About 14
or 15 years old. Right before we put Poison together, there was a local band called
The Kids and they needed a bass player. I was doing the guitar thing and I kept
noticing that nobody needed a guitar player, everybody needed bass players. So
I went out and bought a bass, and learned five songs. I went and did an audition
with The Kids, long story short I didn't get the gig. But it was a week later
we put Poison together, and here we are. 

**WM:** So how did you know Rikki and
Bret?

> **BD:** I was introduced from a mutual friend. The guy that taught
me the five songs on bass. We originally started as Paris, and we went to Los
Angles from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The original guy lasted about a half year
in LA, and then we got CC Deville. 

**WM:** So how long was it between CC joining
and the band signing with Enigma Records?

> **BD:** Not long. Probably within
six months to a year.

**WM:** Do you attribute that to timing, or the chemistry
between the four of you?

> **BD:** Both. 

**WM:** So twenty years ago a majority
of the critics dismissed Poison as a no-talent flash in the pan. And twenty years
later, here you are.

> **BD:** Do those same critics still have their jobs?
(laughs)

**WM:** And the great thing about it now is that a lot of today's critics
grew up with your music.

> **BD:** Yes, absolutely. That's one of the great
things as you mature and become older. When you first start out, your fans are
15 and 16 years old. Then one day they run the golf course you're playing on.
It's a great feeling. 

**WM:** So you have a new greatest hits out with a new
song on it.

> **BD:** Yes. We did a remake of "We're An American Band" by
Grand Funk Railroad. 

**WM:** Did you shoot a video for that?

> **BD:** We
made a video with in the studio footage of us making the song. But not an actual
video for release.

**WM:** Have you heard how the sales have been so far on the
CD?

> **BD:** We sold 180,000 copies in 6 weeks.

**WM:** Not bad for a flash
in the panâ€¦

> **BD:** Don't get too close to the fire!

**WM:** Do you have
a favorite Poison song?

> **BD:** (without hesitation) "Ride The Wind."

**WM:**
What about a Poison song you wished you never heard again? 

> **BD:** There's
many songs in both categories, to be honest with you. There's no songs I'm particularly
un-proud of, but there's songs that I've only played one timeâ€¦ and that was to
record them. On every record, there's many of those. If there's 12 songs on a
record, you're probably only going to play 3 or 4 of them ever again. A lot of
those songs get written at the moment in the studio or very shortly prior to going
into the studio. Then you play them once and you never play them again. We're
fortunate that we're one of the bands that has the long greatest hits package.
That's probably one of the reasons for our longevity and our long career. When
you come to a Poison show, you get 12 to 14 top 40 hits.

**WM:** Do you have
a favorite Poison video?

> **BD:** Umâ€¦ I'm definitely a sucker for the first
coupleâ€¦ "Talk Dirty To Me" and "I Want Action." They were all good in their
own way. My favorite scene in a video was the one where I was out of my mind in
"Every Rose", where they're picking me off the stage. 

**WM:** So what wasn't
just exhaustion? (laughs)

> **BD:** Ahhâ€¦ no. I was fucked out of my brain.
(more laughs)

**WM:** Speaking of the "Every Rose" video, it was filmed for
the most part in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Green Bay was also where Poison started
3 of their world tours, citing it as your lucky spot.

> **BD:** Yes, also a
cheap building. There's a lot of factors that play into that. We had a promoter
friend who was from there, so it was cost-effective to start there. There's a
couple of different cities we've started world tours in, and Green Bay is definitely
one of them and definitely a good luck charm. 

**WM:** From what I remember,
you would come a week ahead of time and hang out.

> **BD:** Yeah, we would
do a week of production rehearsals there. It's a great, fun little town. 

**WM:**
Several years ago you had a spinal cord injury, and you had some disks replaced.
How are things now?

> **BD:** I deal with pain quite a bit, but I've dealt
with this for a long time. It's been 15 years ago when I did the original injury
and herniated the disk. 

**WM:** So does it affect your performances now?

> **BD:** It's always there, because I can't lay back on the stage. When I play, I
have to go for it. The adrenaline pumps, and I become a rock star. There's a lot
of times on the stage when I feel something and think that I shouldn't have done
that. (laughs) But I can't control it. 

**WM:** Where would Bobby Dall be today
if your music career never took off?

> **BD:** I'd probably be running the
planet.

**WM:** Good answer! Poison is the epitome of the party rock band. 

> **BD:** As we get older, we are singled out as the pioneer of the glam party band.
We were always about having nothing but a good time. Not to quote a pun! (laughs)

**WM:**
So here you are in the ultimate party rock band 20 years later, and you're a father.
Are those conflicting roles in your life?

> **BD:** Well, I'm not the same
person that I was at the beginning of this band. That's just life. I'm 10 years
sober now, and I don't smoke anymore. I'm much healthier. You do reach an age
where you say (to your children) 'Do as I say, not as I did.' But that's anyone's
life. I have a 15 year old son, and a 9 year old daughter.

**WM:** And what do
your kids think of Poison?

> **BD:** They both love it. My son travels with
me at all times. And my daughter comes in and out about every 3 weeks. My son
grew up on a tour bus, and it's what he loves. 

**WM:** What are you listening
to music-wise?

> **BD:** Well, I grew up in the 70's. I think the things that
influenced you as a teen probably stay with you longer. I'm always a big fan of
the 70's. Van Halen, The Rolling Stones, Cheap Trick, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin,
so forth and so on. But I'm in the music business and I like a lot of new music
as well. The Killers are one of the most important new bands. Green Day, although
they're not too new, are having their run the last couple of years. I think the
last record they did is just amazing. I'm a fan of a lot of pop, just a fan of
a lot of music. That's what I do. I can hear a country song and say that's a great
song, and I can hear a great pop song and say that's a great pop song.

**WM:**
Do you follow American Idol?

> **BD:** I think we've hit a reality TV phase
in the cycle of the entertainment industry. I don't know if I'm necessary a fan,
but I have followed a little bit of it here and there. I'm usually not a fan of
the winner. But I give credit where it's due. I think Kelly Clarkson and Clay
Akin are important to the pop culture. Our business is very cynical, and the reality
phase is quite interesting. There's some of it I do enjoy, but I wouldn't say
that American Idol is my favorite reality TV.

**WM:** What do you watch?

> **BD:** I like the celeb realty. I like Flavor Flav if you wanna know. I think Flav
should rule the world! (laughs)

**WM:** Back when you started out 20 years ago,
magazines like Metal Edge helped expose Poison, and today the internet has taken
over with that exposure. Are you active on the internet?

> **BD:** Absolutely.
I have been for 10 years. 

**WM:** So you're familiar with sites like Metal Sludge?

> **BD:** Absolutely. Good ol' Stevie Rachelle.

**WM:** Stevie's actually from Wisconsin.
What are your thoughts on the Sludge site?

> **BD:** I think it's a fantastic
website. I wished he never would have come out of the closet. I thought it was
a little more interesting when we didn't know who was running it. But it's still
a great website. 

**WM:** In watching the old Poison videos, there's several
of them that show you in the crowd partyingâ€¦ and the people around you don't even
know you're Bobby Dall. Did you do that a lot?

> **BD:** I do that a lot still.
I don't really have a persona above what you see on the stage. I don't spend my
time trying to be something other than what Poison is on that stage. So because
of that, I'm pretty much capable of going where and when and how I wanna go. I
purposefully live my life so that I could do that. And that's the way I like it.


**WM:** Any message to your fans here in Wisconsin?

> **BD:** I've been blessed,
God bless them!

Life isn't always a fairy tale, even when you have a fairy tale name.
Take for example the band Cinderella. Although very popular in the late 80's and
early 90's, they paid their dues and to this day find obstacles in their path.
But out on the road for the "Rock Never Stops" tour, Cinderella isn't stopping
either. Read on, in this exclusive interview with lead singer Tom Keifer:

**WM:**
Hi Tom. So you're on the tail end of the Rock Never Stops tour?

> **TK:** Yeah,
we've got about three weeks left. We go until the 28th of August.

**WM:** How
have the shows been?

> **TK:** They've been great. We've had really really
great crowds. We've been out most of the summer, and we're really having a good
time.

**WM:** I've read recently that you've been having some throat problems
that started in the 90's, and continue to this day. As the tour goes on, is that
something that you struggle with?

> **TK:** Nah, I'm having a good tour vocally.
The problem started early in the 90's, and it's a pretty long story. Long story
short, I woke up one day and my voice was just gone. I couldn't hit notes and
I had no control over it. I flew around to a bunch of different specialists all
over the country, and no one could figure out what was wrong. I didn't have any
nodes or any cysts, so they told me that I must have just forgotten how to sing.
(laughs) I didn't think that's what happened. Finally a doctor diagnosed me with
a neurological condition, which is like a paralysis of the left vocal cord. I
had to teach myself how to sing all over again. We recorded our 4th record after
a few years of therapy. I was able to record that record in pieces, a lot of punching
and comping of vocals. We went out and did a short tour for that. Then the band
broke up, and I continued working with vocal coaches. It's just gotten stronger
and stronger. We reformed in '98 and it's just getting better and better. I'm
back 100% or better even.

**WM:** A brief history of Cinderella (inspiration)

> **TK:** I think the inspiration came from playing in countless bars and cover bands,
playing other peoples music. I just decided one day that that was not what I wanted
to do anymore. I wanted to start something where I could do my own original music.
The band was put together with that thought in mind, that we're not going to do
any covers, just our own stuff. My personal inspiration came from bands like the
Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, The Eagles, Humble Pie, Bad Company, Deep Purple, and
all those great bands from the 70's.

**WM:** How did you come up with the name
Cinderella?

> **TK:** We were actually sitting around watching TV one night,
flipping through an HBO guide. We had been kicking around different names, and
we saw the name Cinderella for the movie in the guide. It wasn't the Disney version
though, it was the porno version! (laughs) But that really didn't have anything
to do with us selecting the name, we just thought it was cool. In the early 80's,
most band names were very obvious to the sound of their music. If it was a heavy
band, it was a very heavy name. So we were a hard rock band with a name that really
didn't sound like what we sounded like. I always thought that was cool with bands
like Queen, Kiss, or Sweet. A light name describing something heavy. And it just
kind of caught on.

**WM:** How did Jon Bon Jovi become a part of your Cinderella
story?

> **TK:** We had been shopping a record deal for a year or two with
different lawyers and managers, and we had received a lot of rejection letters.
We just hooked up with a new manager, Larry Nazer, and he was going around for
the third time to all the major labels. He handed a tape in Derek Showman at PolyGram
Records, who is the guy who signed Bon Jovi. Derek was riding the fence on it,
and honestly I don't blame him, because our demos were terrible. We were very
green in the studio, so the demos weren't a good representation. But Jon was in
Philadelphia recording their second record, 7800 Degrees Fahrenheit. We were playing
at a local club that we played almost every weekend, and he stopped in after the
studio one night. He really liked the band, and he came back to the dressing room.
We knew who he was, because Runaway was a hit off his 1st record. He just told
use that he really liked the show, and that was it. Later that week, our manager
said that Jon was at PolyGram and talked to Derek Showman about the band. Derek
said he wasn't crazy about the demos, and Jon told him to check us out live because
we were a great live band. So Derek came down and saw us play, and signed us to
a developmental deal for six months. We wrote some more songs, and recorded them
in a studio, and then he finally signed us.

**WM:** How long were you a bar band
before the contact came along?

> **TK:** Hmmâ€¦ about two or three years. Maybe
even more.

**WM:** So it definitely wasn't an overnight success.

> **TK:** (laughs) Nothing ever really is. It all accumulates from the time you first pick
up a guitar.

**WM:** How long have you been playing guitar?

> **TK:** Since
I was eight!

**WM:** Was it ever a goal of yours growing up to be a rock star?

> **TK:** I think my goal when I first picked it up was to play music, and that continues
to be my goal. Being a rock star is something that just comes along with being
successful at playing music.

**WM:** All of your videos have been recently released
for the first time on DVD, which you provided a commentary track for. 

> **TK:** That was a lot of fun to do, we were real involved with this package. We
had two other greatest hits before this. The first one we were kind of involved
in, the second one we weren't involved in at all. This one we were involved with
track selection, the DVD menus, re-mastering the tracks, and the commentaries.
We're real happy with how it turned out. To us this is the definitive collection.

**WM:**
Was the DVD something you wanted to do personally, or was it something that the
label came to you with?

> **TK:** We've been wanting that for years. We felt
like every other band from that era had a DVD out with their videos on it, and
they finally decided they wanted to put it out. When they approached us about
it, we were like 'YES! Thank you!'

**WM:** I was surprised to see a very natural
looking Pamela Anderson in your video for "Shelter Me". I think she looked better
then than the Hollywood version of her. 

> **TK:** Yeah, she was an unknown
when she made that video. It probably was one of her first acting jobs.

**WM:**
And you also had Little Richard in there, it's a great video..

> **TK:** Yeah,
that's one of my favorites.

**WM:** You've been doing a lot of tours since Cinderella
reunited in '98 without any new music. Is there anything planned on the horizon?

> **TK:** Well, not at the moment. And the reason for that is after we reformed we
were signed to Sony Records. We signed the deal in '98, and did a brief tour in
theaters and clubs. Then we started the process of writing songs for the next
record. That process continued until 2001, when the label finally signed off on
the material, a budget and a producer. About a week after that happened, without
getting into a lot of detail, we had a falling out with the label which ended
up in a lawsuit. The record was never made, the lawsuit is still on going, and
we're tied up in courts as far as new Cinderella music. In the meantime, we've
built our tour industry back up, and we've all been working on side projects.
I have a solo record that's coming out probably early next year. I've been working
on it for the past couple of years.

**WM:** Will it be an independent release,
or will you shop it to labels?

> **TK:** Well, the record is finished and produced,
and ready to deliver. Now I'm going to take it out to labels and try and find
a home for it. That's the process that I've started now.

**WM:** Do you play
any of your new solo material out on the road?

> **TK:** No, this tour is basically
a greatest hits and favorite album tracks. There's a lot of album tracks that
weren't singles that were really big live for us.

**WM:** Going back to the Sony
album that was never released, did you ever end up recording any of them?

> **TK:** We didn't record any masters, but we recorded demos. Some of them I recorded
for my solo album.

**WM:** The 60's had Mick Jagger, the 70's had Steven Tylor,
and in my opinion the 80's have you. You all seem like you're cut from the same
cloth, both in performance and even in appearance. 

> **TK:** Well, I take
that as a major compliment. I just want to go on the record and say that you said
that, I didn't. (laughs) Both of them was obviously a big influence on me. I think
that I listen to a lot of things that probably influenced them. Like old blues,
gospel, and R&B records, I just love that whole sound. The early rock n roll
stuff, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. It's timeless, because it's roots music.
And real pure rock n roll is roots music on 12! Rock n roll is the culmination
of all the American roots music. There's a little bit of gospel, there's a little
bit of country, there's a little bit of R&B, and there's a lot of blues. That's
the music that I love, and that's the music that I set out to write and play.
That's what Cinderella does, and I think we've gotten better at it with each record
more from a production standpoint. People think we changed with each record, but
I look at it as we grew. The first record was very blues based melodies and guitars
licks. It was very basic production, and we grew our production more with instrumentation
and adding instruments and stuff. Where we ended up with "Heartbreak Station"
is where we wanted to be on the first record, but we were learning. 

**WM:**
Is there anything in your past catalog of music that you would revamp or change
if you could?

> **TK:** I'd like to remix "Long Cold Winter". Not that I
don't like the mixes, because I think at the time they were great. But I'd love
to hear that record dry, without all the effects and reverb. When I listen back
on all the records, "Heartbreak Station" is the one that doesn't sound dated
and the reason is because there's no dating effects on it. When you hear the bombastic
reverb on a share drum, you go "THAT'S 80's!". (laughs) And I got really tired
of that sound after the second record, and the sound of "Heartbreak Station"
was very intentional. I remember walking into the studio, walking over the board,
and grabbing the faders where the reverb returns were and just pulling them down.
I've approached music that way ever since. Put a mic in front an amp or drum,
and that's it. That's all you need.

**WM:** Looking down the roadâ€¦ once everything
is resolved with Sony, do you see another Cinderella record at some point?

> **TK:** I think it's a possibility. 

**WM:** And would it be more of a modern version
of Cinderella, or back where you left off in the mid-90's?

> **TK:** I think
it would be was what Cinderella does. I don't think we would try to change in
any way. We would just try to have better songs, and to sing better and play better.
At least that's what we've tried with each record we do. You always want to grab
a little bit of some of the cutting edge technology or sound and use some of that
on your record. And that's cool, as long it's done in a way that it works with
the music. 

**WM:** What are you personally listening to these days?

> **TK:** There's a very things that have come out in the past 5 or 6 years that I really
like. I really enjoy Train. I think they're a great band, they write great songs,
and they make great records. A lot of Matchbox 20 stuff I really like. Macy Grey
is really cool. Those are a few artists that really stood out to me in the past
few years. 

**WM:** Do you still listen to the older stuff, like the Stones?

> **TK:** Yeah, I still listen to that. Honestly, I don't listen to a lot of music
in a recreational way. If I'm not on tour, I'm in the studio or I'm writing songs.
So I'm listening to music all day long when I'm working. Once and awhile I'll
get a little time off, and I'll feel like pulling out a record and listening to
it. 

**WM:** Anything to say to the Cinderella fans in Wisconsin who have supported
you over the years?

> **TK:** Man, what can I say? We appreciate all of you
hanging in with us throughout the years and always coming out to see us. I can't
say how much it means to us.

There are singers in the industry that "just get by", and then there
are singers that other singers admire and aspire to be like. David Coverdale is
a singer of the latter group. Since the 70's he's inspired fans, fellow musicians
and industry folk alike. Disappearing for most of the 1990's, David is back with
a revamped Whitesnake and a major league attitude. Read on, in this exclusive
interview with Wisconsin Music:

**WM:** Hello David.

> **DC:** Hello! Where
are you, bro?

**WM:** In Green Bay, Wisconsin.

> **DC:** Oh, lovely!

**WM:**
You will be here July 7th.

> **DC:** I've got two shows in your neck of the
woods, don't I?

**WM:** Yes, July 7th is in Green Bay, and July 8th will be about
an hour and a half away in Milwaukee at Summerfest.

> **DC:** Perfect.

**WM:**
It's going to be some great shows. There will be a lot of people there.

> **DC:** Looking forward to it, doll. Are we doing radio or press?

**WM:** This
is going to be a little of both, actually.

> **DC:** So I better watch the
inflammatory oratory.

**WM:** We'll just take a couple of mp3 clips, we can always
bleep 'em out if we need to.

> **DC:** (laughs) Put some Britney Spears blips
in!

**WM:** Exactly. (laughs)

> **DC:** (Screams a high note) Ok, thank you!

**WM:**
If we could just take a few minutes, and just have brief rundown of your illustrious
career?

> **DC:** Oh my God, a few minutes, you're talking about over 30 years!
I was born at a very early age, spent most of my life trying to get back in. So
that's that summed up â€¦ (laughs)

> Other than playing in local bands, my
first taste of working as a professional musician was with Deep Purple. 

**WM:**
What a band to start with!

> **DC:** That's was just an incredible baptism
of fire for me. And a lot of the incredible lessons I learned at that time, I
still implement today. Two very influential and inspirational people were Ritchie
Blackmore the guitarist, and John Lord, the keyboard player. Yeah, so that was
an incredible time. 

> I came out of Deep Purple, I really didn't want to
be part of the disintegration of the band. I was very honored to be given that
opportunity. But near the end, some of the new blood in the band was tending to
kind of tear it down somewhat.

> So I got out of there. I had a year and
a half where I think I made two solo records. Very cheaply, since the Deep Purple
management wasn't backing me. (chuckles) I was kind of the new pony in that setup.
And then I put Whitesnake together, to actually promote a solo album in the United
Kingdom called Northwinds. I was told there wasn't really an audience for what
I was doing. But what ultimately happened, I went out on a small club tour, and
found out I had four times as many people outside trying to get back in. So, Whitesnake
actually grew very quickly and rapidly in Europe and in the Far Eastâ€¦ but I never
really crossed the water. I kept getting told, 'Oh, you've got to come over to
the States' but we never really had a good record deal in place or anything.

> I got to the point with the management, who I'd inherited from Deep Purple,
that I couldn't deal with them anymore. I felt that every step forward that I
took forward in my career, they made decisions which caused me to slip three or
four steps back. So, I bit the bullet and divorced the management, for very significant
money. A million dollars, which I certainly didn't have!

> Then I got a call
from David Geffin, asking me if it was true I was divorcing my manager. Obviously,
my managers had very good reputations! As soon as I said, 'yes, that is the case'
he said, 'Well, I'm very interested in talking with you.' Suddenly the sun came
out from behind the clouds! 

> Also at that time, my marriage and my private
life was pretty much up in the air. So I closed everything down in Europe and
moved lock stock and barrel to Los Angeles. I thought that I'd take America on
from the inside. And then sold 40 million records in a very short space of time!

> I retired at the end of 1990. I divorcedâ€¦ contrary to what my ex-wife says, that
she divorced me. But if anyone wants to look on file, I was the petitioner, not
the girl in the videos. (Tawny Kitaen)

> Then I met a girl in the Tahoe area,
who has turned out to be the best partner I have ever, ever considered being blessed
with. She's blessed me with a son, who is now nine this year. I wanted to experience
what it was like to be a parent â€¦ because I have a daughter, who was born at exactly
the time I was making my first Whitesnake album. I had no idea of bonding, I thought
it was dental work. (laughs)

> What happened, I was away working, and I was
the man who'd turn up for several years with an armful of gifts and that was it.
So my daughter and I, I'm very happy to say, have a phenomenal relationship. But
we still deal with issues of why Daddy wasn't there a great deal of the time.
That's a problem I think a lot of my colleagues and peers have experienced. So
ultimately, moving forward very quickly, I didn't want to go through that with
my son. 

> So, that brings us up to 2003. I'd been working for EMI, putting
some compilations together, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Whitesnake. A
lot people suddenly starting asking me, why don't you go out and do some shows?
Some of the calls I got were from my old friends, the Scorpions. So, I thought,
'Ok', so we went out on a co-headliner. The first time in America for 12 years.
We played to great crowds. Actually, I went out for two months and ended up back
nine months later.

> I'd missed it unbelievably. So that was a very busy
year. You know, my plan was to do six months a year, maximum, and I've got to
effect balance in my life. I love my family and I love being home with them. Now
my son is of an age where he can travel with us.

**WM:** That's great.

> **DC:** Yeah, it's quite a perfect existence. The reason I'm doing smaller venues,
quite honestly, on some of these shows, is the perception. I want to try to change
the perception of Whitesnake. When we talked about going out, a lot of the promoters
wanted an '80s package, with me and a bunch of contemporaries from that time.
I've done this for 30-odd years, sold 70 million records, why would I want to
group myself into a kind of niche? So, I want to try to change the perception
by re-birthing Whitesnake, doing it this way.

**WM:** So will you be taking your
son out on the road for this tour?

> **DC:** Some of the time. Obviously, we
won't let anything mess with his school, he's a very bright student. Europe was
really difficult for me last year. We went over literally for six weeks, and ended
up coming back twelve weeks later. It was an interminable time for me to be separated
from my son. We developed communicating on I-Chat cameras, which just saved my
life, you know? 

**WM:** I like your choice of words earlier. You divorced your
management, your record labelâ€¦ in correlation to things that were going on in
your personal life at the time. It seems like several times in your life, you've
literally had to divorce everything. Walk away, and start over.

> **DC:** Absolutely.
And do it again, if it ever happened. I'm not prepared to tolerate any kind of
indignity in my life. By the same token, I'm at a great spot in my life, where
I hold no grudge. Part of the journey I'm on, is forgiveness. It has to be. It's
a huge element in the big picture. It serves no positive purpose whatsoever to
hold negative energy for any experience. Those experiences were necessary. I don't
suppose many of your readers will have heard of a French chanteuse called Edith
Piaf. She had a gigantic hit in Europe, after the war, called "No Regrets."
I'm the Edith Piaf of rock. There's been some very questionable scenarios, but
I feel they were all necessary for me to find out who I am, how I deal with things.

> And of course I am a complete, devout believer in karma. I will definitely
have to experience anything that I put anyone through on my journey.

**WM:**
Does that mean at some point somebody's going to have you prancing around on the
hood of a Jaguar?

> **DC:** Well, I've been there! I've done it. But it was
only for polishing. (laughs) But I do want my hood ornament back!

**WM:** You
sound like you're at a really great place in your life right now.

> **DC:** Marvelous.

**WM:** Throughout your career, you've worked literally with the finest
rock guitarists ever. Ritchie Blackmore, John Sykes, Jimmy Pageâ€¦ 

> **DC:** Well, not only that, don't short-sell the bass players and the drummers, the keyboard
players. I've been extraordinarily fortunate. 

**WM:** Just incredible.

> **DC:** The remarkable thing is, the two sort of better known musicians I've worked
with were incredibly inspirational to me, Ritchie Blackmore and Jimmy Page. But
everybody I've worked with has brought something to the party, whether it was
positive or negative. And I'm grateful for all of that.

**WM:** And your guitar
players currently in Whitesnake are no strangers in the rock circles either.

> **DC:** Doug Aldrich and Reb Beach. Both great harp players. Got a great new bass
player, I'm not if you'll have heard of him: Ryan Duffyâ€¦

**WM:** That was a question
I was going to ask later, but let's cover it now. That's within the past month,
correct?

> **DC:** Actually, it's been going on for some time. I worked beautifully
with a fabulous musician and a great guy called Marco Mendoza. He's a master musician.
But he just can't sit still for two minutes. I'd explained my philosophy of working,
and everybody accepted that. But Marco would be consistently going, 'Are we gonna
work, are we gonna work, are we gonna work' and it was like, 'Enough already!
No, we've just done six months.' So he would take other projects, and I said,
with my blessing, as long as they don't conflict with Whitesnake activities.

> But they did. So, we just wished each other well. I love him very dearly,
and do sincerely wish him well. But I cannot conduct my life around somebody else's
agenda. 

**WM:** So how did you come across your new player?

> **DC:** There's
a lot of people, surprisingly, who wanted to jump in the band, from very dark
musical bands. You know, kind of metal-goth-grunge, and it was weird for me. I'm
not sure I want that energy for what I do. But Uriah was the only one I spoke
to. I felt a connection immediately, just going over his website and stuff. We
met, and got on extraordinarily well. He's another master musician. And he continues
the theme of that exotic bass player that Coverdale picks, you know?

> He's
actually working now in London with the Family Stone. I'm sure you remember Sly
and the Family Stone, this is some of the original members, and they're keeping
that music alive. Fortunately, because it's one of my favorite elements of all
time. So he's a great groove player, as well as a rock player. He's a bit too
good-looking, but we can't have everything. But it should keep us on our toes.

**WM:**
One thing you mentioned a little earlier is that you don't want to be pigeon-holed
as an '80s hair band... 

> **DC:** No!

**WM:** And now you're continuing that
tradition, whether it be the people in your band, orâ€¦

> **DC:** Oh yeah. My
wife and I were channel surfing a couple of years ago, and we came across an "In
concert with Dave Matthews", and this phenomenal united nations of musicians
working with him was just so inspiring to me. I was actually just working out
this morning to a DVD of my old mate David Bowie, and he has this beautiful bald
female African-American bass player. I have no blinders to say that is not a possibility
one day for Whitesnake, if the situation arose. If a black guy would work in a
band called Whitesnake, I wouldn't have a problem. (laughs)

**WM:** There's a
couple of things that's tied into the overall public image of Whitesnake. You
are probably the biggest one, being that you yourself are Whitesnake. The other
image, that we just kind of briefly touched on a minute ago, was Tawney sprawled
out on the hood of your car.

> **DC:** Oh, indeed. Yeah, huge. We were the
Rolling Stone cover of the year, much to Madonna's chagrin. I know that personally,
because Sean Penn told me. He said, 'Oh my God, she was so pissed'. So I've kept
out of her way! (laughs)

> Whenever I checked into a hotel in America and
put the TV on in the suite, 9 times out of 10, MTV was the station that had been
left on from the previous occupant. And 8 times out of 10 it was that Whitesnake
video playing. I really don't come from that promotional school. When I worked
with Pagey (Jimmy Page), and Geffin wanted us to do videos, he was completely
uncomfortable. I was going, well this is what we do now, Jimmy! This is what we
have to do. We created this monster, MTV, and now you have to do basically whatever
they wanted.

> The idea for me, as a musician, of doing 3 or 4 minute video,
which has absolutely nothing to do with the song content, was the strangest shit.
But then again, for three years, I sold frightening amounts of records, and all
the other aspects of that scenario. 

**WM:** Do you recall who's idea was it
to throw Tawney on top of the car?

> **DC:** Well, Tawney was one of my girlfriends
at that time. The original Whitesnake girl was supposed to be Claudia Schiffer,
when she was the Guess jeans girl. Right at the last minute, there were problems.
We were in L.A., and my director called me and said, 'can you stop by the house,
I want to talk over a few things.' So instead of taking Tawney out for dinner,
talk about synchronity, we went by his house at Beverly Hills. He opens the door,
and his jaw hit the floor. I mean, Tawney was spectacular to look at. An extraordinarily
pretty woman. And he went, 'That's her! that's the Whitesnake woman, that's the
Whitesnake woman.' And I went, 'Marty, this is a friend of mine, I don't mix business
and pleasure.' Tawney, affecting modesty, said, 'Ah, don't be silly David. I wouldn't
mind at all!' (laughs) And grabbed it with both hands. She brought an incredible
element and attention to my work.

> "Here We Go Again" is a song about
marital breakup. My first marriage had nothing to do with Tawneyâ€¦ or indeed white
Jags. But I think people have gotten past seeing the white Jag in their mind's
eye when that song comes on, I'm very happy to say.

**WM:** Last year, you had
Adrian Vandenberg join you onstage again.

> **DC:** That's right, yeah, my
old brother. I love him very dearly, he's a great guy. There's an interview with
him on Whitesnake.com that people might be interested in.

**WM:** I saw that.


> **DC:** Yeah, he's a very dear friend of mine, and welcome wherever I am.
In fact, I'm sincerely hoping â€“ you know, he was always staying with us at the
house a lot, we were very close â€¦ he survived two marriages, of mine, and anyone
who'd ever been in Whitesnake, he was the longest survivor. He's a very good person,
a great soul. He would still probably be with me now, but he has an injury which
prevents him from being able to hold a guitar for too long. Certainly not to do
a show.

**WM:** Is that a permanent?

> **DC:** Well, they're working on it.
I don't think so. You know, I subscribe to a different healing method. I think
one of the reasons I'm trying to get him over here is to throw him to my healers,
which are not the conventional antibiotic injection route. Cause a lot of that
does as much damage, if not more, than the actual injury. But that is my philosophy,
and I don't force it on others.

**WM:** That would be great to hear him play
again.

> **DC:** Yeah, he is indeed an incredible player. I've got a lot of
time for Adrian.

**WM:** So how did your current rock 'n roll, rhythm-and-blues
tour come about?

> **DC:** It was once again trying to separate from this image.
When my new manager found resistance for me to go out with somebody like Johnny
Lang or Kenny Wayne Shepard, they wanted me to go out with bands from the '80s.
You know, that tied into this hair aspect. We said, we have to effectively change.
It doesn't affect us anywhere else in the world, it's just literally here. A very
small mentality which can't let go of that '80s package thing. So we said, let's
do a European-style tour of theaters, under our own steam rather than go along
with the big Clear Channel aspect of the '80s package.

**WM:** And you were able
to get VH-1 to back it.

> **DC:** Yeah! Old mates, I think, from glory days,
you know.

**WM:** It seems that music kind of goes in circles.

> **DC:** Oh,
it's all cyclical.

**WM:** Now, if ever there was a tour to celebrate Deep Purple
that would include previous members of the band, is that something you'd participate
in?

> **DC:** Oh, I don't think you'd find dressing rooms big enough to accommodate
those egos! 

**WM:** (laughs)

> **DC:** No, after I joined Deep Purple, in
a very short space of time, it degenerated into five egomaniacs fighting for the
spotlight. I have no idea how they are now. I do hear stories, as you can imagine.
But, I actually had a chance encounter with John Laud a couple of years ago. I
said, "Here, what's all this stuff I hear about your dream is to have all former
members and current members of Deep Purple appearing for one night?" I said,
"If Ritchie does it, and it's for charity, I'll do it." He said, "Oh, it was
the booze talking, David!" (laughs)

> You know, he was talking to some journalists.
But now of course, with this incredible internet, just an aside remark can fly
around. I mean, I still deal with people asking me on my website, 'Was there any
truth to the rumor that you were joining Van Halen?' Where the hell that came
out I have no idea! No, absolutely not.

**WM:** Maybe Eddie talking...

> **DC:** Who knows? But it suddenly becomes like the Constitution, if you've read
a rumor. We've actually put on our website, 'Please don't be spreading rumors
on here that you've heard from other websites.'

**WM:** I believe there was a
rumor going around that Whitesnake actually broke up recently. Which is kind of
funny being that you're about to head out on tour.

> **DC:** I think that probably
came from Marco leaving, the change. It's very interesting. Once again, this is
usually the internet. It fuels, it's like a form of brushfire. It spreads incredibly.
We've very fortunate. We have an incredibly successful and very active website,
so we can usually get damage control. I work with some pretty powerful people,
who have access to other avenues of media. I n order to stem that kind of stuff.

> You know, there's a tribute band to Whitesnake in Europe. The singer came off
his bike, and it was in the newspaper in Germany. For the first few Whitesnake
shows, it actually affected my business. The article said, 'Whitesnake had to
cancel their tour, because the singer is in hospital after sustaining injuries
in a motorcycle accident.' So those things you just have to be careful of. But
the challenges continue, and if you're a wuss, you let them get the better of
you.

**WM:** Roll with the punches.

> **DC:** Yeah, get on with it. 

**WM:**
You have a new DVD coming out, what can you tell us about that?

> **DC:** That's
being put back until mid to late summer. The guy coordinating just had a heart
attack, and I think probably because he was watching it too much. Fortunately
he's on the mend now, which is why I can be flippant about it. And Geffin are
coming out with a double-CD called the Gold Series, which will feature some early
Whitesnake, some unreleased mixes of pretty well known songs. Previously unreleased,
of course. And Doug Aldrich is currently putting some beefcake guitars on a song
of mine. If it comes out well we're going to give to Geffin so there's a complete
new song for it.

**WM:** That's excellent. 

> **DC:** For the discerning buyer.

**WM:**
Is there a proposed release date on that?

> **DC:** I think they're going to
try and tie that into what we're doing. It's the strangest time now. I don't recognize
how these companies do business, Brett. I'm very happy to say that I'm somewhat
divorced from it, I'm delighted to say! Even when I was completely caught up in
that time, because I've always balanced this fine line of musician and businessman
â€“ I saw, so many years ago, so many musicians being taken advantage of. I thought
the only common sense is to keep an eye on what's going on. I would always have
independent lawyers and independent accounts from other people, and if I don't
understand something, I do ask what it means. I pass that suggestion on to anybody
who considers taking a career in an industry where overnight you can become very
wealthy and successful. Because for all the people who applaud you, there are
certainly enough people who try to take advantage, and help themselves to whatever
you've achieved. Success has many parents.

**WM:** Any message to the Whitesnake
fans in Wisconsin?

> **DC:** Can't wait to see you again!

title: Gunnar Nelson
slug: gunnar-nelson
date: '2005-05-22'
---

There's a lot that goes into having a successful music career. Good songs,
image, management, and promotion are just a few of the things that separate the
local bar bands from the arena head-liners. Although Mathew and Gunnar Nelson
might have had a jump start on the competition due to them being from the musical
Nelson family, they certainly paid their dues. Read on, in this exclusive interview
with Gunnar Nelson:

**WM:** Can you give us a brief history of Nelson, as in
you and your brother?

> **GN:** Brief history â€¦ ok, well, our first memories
were of watching our dad perform, beside the stage. We actually watched him do
his thing and make people happy, and we decided that's what we wanted to do, forever.
I was seven when I got my first drum set and about six months later Matthew got
his first bass. They stuck us out in the barn, and we began playing and getting
our chops together. We started playing professionally from the time we were twelve.
We actually played the LA club scene on the same stages as bands like the Go-Gos,
the Bangles â€¦ you know, the whole 80's New Wave thing. We were very very young,
but we'd been playing for a long time. It was right around that time we had our
first recording session, that our dad produced, and that was really the final
nail in the coffin. As far as our mom was concerned, she never wanted us to get
into music, so â€¦ that was really it. Our dad produced that session, the Pointer
Sisters sang backup, and that's when we really knew that was it for our lives!

> We spent our high school years playing the LA club scene as well as rehearsing,
and getting things together. Our dad passed away when we were 18 years old, on
his way to a gig. We had already booked ourselves playing Saturday Night Live
as the only unsigned band to ever do it. We decided to go through with the show,
but at the time I was back on drums and Matthew was up front singing by himself
on bass. After we played Saturday Night Live I felt, man, there's so much turbulence
right now, so much chaos in the air, that if we're ever going to make a change
now's the time to do it. And I decided to learn how to play guitar. Spent a year
doing that, and came up front with Matt. And that's when we went from our high
school band to the Nelson that everybody sees now.

> We hooked up with Mark
Canner, our producer and co-writer, and spent the next couple of years writing
songs and really getting the trip together. We got signed by John Kalodner over
at Geffin Records, and put the After the Rain record together. The first song,
"Love and Affection", went #1 on our 22nd birthday. That made us the only family
in history with 3 generations of #1 hitmakers. Our dad had two, and grandfather
Ozzie had one in 1934 with a song of his called "And Then Some."

> Then
we just toured like crazy. We did 206 shows with the band we had at the time,
which was Bobby Rock on drums, and Paul Mercovich on guitar, Joey Capcard on rhythm,
and Brett Garset on lead guitar. It was a six person band. We toured the world
and back, literally. Then the whole music scene changed. Right around that time,
the whole confidence rock of "Living on a Prayer" was over, replaced by the
shoe gazers and security rock of Seattle. Everybody from our particular generation
was trying to figure out what they were going to do. Like our father was trying
to figure out what to do after the "Ozzie and Harriet Show" ended and the year
of the singer/songwriter was here for the first time, in the '60s. Just like he
put together his Stone Canyon Band and became a singer/songwriter and hit with
"Garden Party" all over again, Matthew and I have been spending the last six
years playing shows all over the world and really connecting with our audience
during the show and especially after, when we meet everybody. Putting our trip
together now, which is currently has one foot firmly in rock and the other firmly
in country. We're doing our own thing, which we just call American music.

**WM:**:
That's great. Now you mentioned your first session was produced by your dad. Has
that ever seen the light of day?

> **GN:** Actually, we put that on as a hidden
track on a record of ours. We've made nine records to date, and that particular
song was called "Feelings of Love", and we sound like the Chipmunk. (laughs)
It was the first thing that Matthew ever wrote, and it was pretty cool. We put
it on as a hidden track on The Silence in Broken record.

**WM:** And that was
self-released?

> **GN:** Yeah, it was on Stone Canyon records.

**WM:** So
now you mentioned you were signed to Geffin Records, and John Kalodner was the
one who signed you. He's pretty much a take-it-or-leave-it kind of guy, right?
It's John's way or the highway?

> **GN:** Yes. Yes.

**WM:** Have you talked
to John recently?

> **GN:** Absolutely. We just got off tour with Peter Frampton
and Styx, and we saw John when we were out on tour. It was really great to see
John. Back in the day, you've got to understand, what we were all trying to do
together was very, very different from what anybody else was doing. Everybody
else was trying to do the "top of the now" "still beyond it" "girlfriend's
kinda black & white video" trip. What we wanted to come out with John was
really a modern version of the Hollies. We wanted to do stuff that was like very
vocally heavy, with lots of harmonies. We wanted a colorful presentation, and
we just wanted to really unique. You know, the MTV era was obviously here to stay.
We all figured that people were going to be flipping through their video channels,
and any new band is going to have, at most, a second and a half of somebody's
time when they're flipping through the channelsâ€¦ whether or not they're going
to park on that channel or not, and we wanted to make sure that we stood out.

> So we worked out everything and really thought about the whole visual presentation
as well, the sonic presentation, and we wanted to make sure the visual could uphold
the audio image of who we were.

> It was really nice being with a guy like
John, who was very much into doing things that were different and unique and special.
Fortunately at the time he had the pull to be able to sway a record company to
do what we wanted to do.

**WM:** That was obviously your most successful record.
Was it triple platinum?

> **GN:** Yeah.

**WM:** That must have been hard to
follow up.

> **GN:** Well, no, not really. See, my father always said that
a career is nothing more than a series of comebacks. But if you're to look at
that from a broad perspective life is nothing more than a series of comebacks.
You know, I remember before Matthew and I got signed. I remember a well-meaning
best friend at the time going, "Well, you're never going to be as famous as your
father, so why even try? What if you guys don't even get signed?" The funny thing
that happens is, once you get signed, well, what if your record never comes out?
What if the record's not a hit? Once it hit #1, well how're you going to follow
that up? That's what we all did to ourselves, in living our lives, and you know
it's a happy problem to have. I think success takes on many different forms, and
it really depends on where you are in your life, as far as what you regard as
successful. 

> My grandpa Ozzie always said, "Doing what you love to do
for a living, and supporting yourself doing what you love to do, is like having
a license to steal." The way I look at it, we've already won before we've left
the house. We're here making music, and doing what we love to do more than anything
else in the world, and not having to compromise that. So just in that sense, there's
really no pressure. Each generation of Nelson has really made their own unique
mark and done their own thing, and I never really felt pressure to uphold any
of that. I never felt pressure to do anything other than my very best. To be honest,
I've known when I've pulled my punches and not done my very best work. And I'm
the one who has suffered for it. I also know when I've done my very best work
at the time, and whether or not it was commercially successful at the time, I
felt successful making it. Because it was art, and I did my best. 

> Like
I've said, we've been doing this since I was seven. We're on our ninth record
right now, and now we're able to do things on our own terms. We're own our own
label, we are our own bosses, we have our own relationships with our own distributors
around the world that get our product out there. The internet has really helped
out a lot, as far as being able to take the music to the people instantly. When
we were signed to our first deal, there was no internet. Even running a fan club,
that was filling an envelope and sticking a stamp on it. Not a big deal when you've
got 20 people in your fan club, but when you've got 20,000 people in your fan
club as active members and you promise them quarterly mailings, do the math! Just
being able to beam out an email to people right now, it's revolutionary!

> Things are really picking up. What I love more than anything, is that the more
the world seems to change, the more technology seems to get us moving faster,
I think people really need music in their lives more now than they ever did before.
They really want a connection with the people that make their favorite music,
that make the soundtracks to their lives. So we make sure we try to do our music
incorporating the best of both worlds. Instant delivery, as well as staying behind
after every show and just talking about life with people. So, for us, that's really
what gets us off making our music, is actually doing both things.

**WM:** After
you recorded After the Rain, your second record was called, Imaginator, is that
correct? 

> **GN:** Yeah, actually the second one was called Imaginator, and
that was the one that we kind of made in seclusion. Geffin was kind of reeling,
trying to figure out what they were going to do with their agenda, everything
had changed with Nirvana. And what were they going to do with the Whitesnakes
of the world, that were signed to their label, and the Nelsons, and all these
other bands. We found that John Kalodner was spending a lot of time with Aerosmith.
I guess Aerosmith was kind of priming itself to leave the label during all of
this change. We were left alone, and we made an album that was really, really
heavy. It was an album called Imaginator, it was actually finished about six months
before Metallica did the Black Album, and it was really intense. It was a conceptual
album, and it definitely was full of piss and vinegar. But again, it was a really
honest record, albeit a serious departure from the pop metal that we had done
on our first record. Even though Geffin didn't want to stick with the same formula
that was on the After the Rain record, they also obviously didn't know what the
next step was going to be. When they heard this particular record it scared the
hell out of them. They were like, 'What happened to these sweet blonde kids for
crying out loud!'

**WM:** (laughs)

> **GN:** But then again they decided to
market it the easiest way they could at the time. The easiest and cheapest way
for them to market the first record was the teen magazines and all that other
kind of stuff. Matt and I never did any interviews for those magazines, they just
decided to do it that way anyways. Whatever, little girls need to rock too, what
can I say. (laughs)

> To make a long story short, they rejected the record.
They heard the Imaginator album, and said, we don't want to release this, we think
it's a mistake, and yada yada yada. And Matt and I were devastated. We spent a
lot of time putting the record together. John Kalodner stepped up and said, 'Well,
I wasn't involved in making that record, but I will be involved in making another
one if you guys want to go back to the drawing board and do it all over again.'

> So that's what we elected to do. We made "Because They Can" record, which I'm
very very proud of. I think it's a wonderful record. It's definitely a record,
listening to it now, which was about 15 years ahead of its time. It's funny, because
it really blends a lot of rock and a lot of country right where the modern country
thing on CMT is really at right now. It's pretty fun. But John's always kind of
been a visionary, and I really enjoyed that record. 

> The problem was, four
and a half years had gone by. So by the time we turned it in, because they canned
the record from when we'd first released the After the Rain album. All of those
fans, obviously life had moved on, things had changed, people had gone very 'alterna'
at the time. For us, our best work that we had done up to that point really only
found an audience overseas and in Japan and the Pacific Rim countries like Indonesia,
Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore, that sort of thing â€¦ so we had to go overseas and
do a lot of touring. That's where we spent the next few years, was actually concentrating
on our overseas following.

> When we came back, the relationship with Geffin
finally dissolved, and we decided to start our own label, which was Stone Canyon
Records, and ever since we've made a record a year.

**WM:** You did eventually
release Imaginator, how many years after the fact was it?

> **GN:** After the
fact, meaning after we turned it into Geffin? About five years.

**WM:** And what
was the response five years later?

> **GN:** It was excellent overseas. It's
a very, very intense record. We had Henry Rollins do a spoken word on it, for
crying out loud!

**WM:** Really?

> **GN:** Yeah! Like I said, very intense.
If Geffin had released it at the time, the Metallica Black Album came out six
months laterâ€¦ It was definitely much more congruent with the kind of live show
we had been doing. Cause we recorded with our touring band, with Bobby Rock and
all those guys. It was definitely congruent with the two years on the road that
we'd spent. We would have felt very comfortable supporting that record.

> I learned an awful lot. I learned that you've got to follow your heart, you've
got to follow your material, but you've got to put out stuff that makes sense
too. I don't know if I'll ever have another major label deal. Not because I don't
feel we could get one. I just don't know, knowing what I know now about the industry,
if I would ever be open to it, to be honest with you. But I think things have
really started changing in the industry, too, in the artist's favor.

**WM:**
So what do you view as the pros and cons for releasing an album independently,
as opposed to being on a label like Geffin?

> **GN:** Real simplyâ€¦ you can
definitely get yourself to be a household name if you get released on a major
and they put all the money behind you. But what people have to understand is when
they sign, a major has got a whole roster, and an agenda for the year, a certain
budget for the year. They are going to wave that magic wand on only one, maybe
two acts in their entire stable. Everybody else, they're going to rely on that
band's built in following, that band's management, that band's own ingenuity to
get themselves promoted out thereâ€¦ regardless of what they tell you in meetings.
The ones that are going to get all the push, all the money, the spaces at radio,
the relationships and favors pulled, are going to be one, maybe two acts. If you're
one of those one, maybe two acts, like Nelson was in the beginning, it's great.
Buckle up and get ready for the ride. 

> However, if you're a band that's
also on that roster and if for some reason, one of those many planets that needs
to align for you did not align, you're going to find yourself stuck. Unable to
make any other music for anybody else, or do any other thing, without your label's
permission. You will have, in a sense, been signed to a slavery contract. So you
need to be very, very careful with that. I would recommend, if you do get into
a major label deal, you make sure you are good enough to create a bidding war.
A bidding war can create some leverage for you and your attorney, to put in some
conditions. 

> Two conditions I would definitely stick to, especially nowadays:
a 'key man' clause, for whoever signs you. If that person leaves the label, like
John Colander left Geffin halfway through our deal, we can elect to go with him
or leave altogether. That's one.

> Second clause: return of your masters
to you. Your masters are your real estate. Make sure that after a certain amount
of time, something that's fair, let's just say it's the length of the contract.
A personal service agreement in Los Angeles can only run seven years. So let's
say at the end of those seven years, your masters belong to you, they don't belong
to the record company. Why is this important? Because so many artists are retiring
and dying broke, for this one particular reason. A major label, any label, its
number one moneymaker is its catalogue. Long after your lead singer has slept
with the bass player's girlfriend and the band has broken up, your label is going
to be out there repackaging and regurgitating all of your masters on all of these
compilations like Monsters of Hair. 

**WM:** Which is really the rage right now,
a lot of '80s compilations â€¦

> **GN:** And you know, the bands that are current
right now, they're going to be on the same compilations ten years from now. The
problem is, as an artist, you do not get paid for that. Your label does. Now arguably,
what they say to you is, well, we're going to make you famous, we're going to
do all of the promotion, and your money is going to be in the touring. And you
get to go out there and you get to tour. Here's the problem. The problem is, yes,
this is true, but, unlike a record, which can get sold and you can make passive
income on without your being there, you need to be there when you play. You can
only play one show a day. You have to travel your balls off to get there. Eat
bad food, lose your relationships, and all that other stuff. So there is a trade-off.
And you have to understand that going into it. So, what you can doâ€¦ 

> Put
it to the readers this way: having a major label deal is like this. Let's say
you want to go buy a house. You go to the bank, and you prove that you're credit-worthy.
You get a loan. You take that loan, you go out and you buy that house. Over the
next ten years, you sacrifice everything in order to pay that bank back the money
that they loaned you for that house. Ten years pass, you've worked really hard,
the fates smile on you, and you are able to pay them back 100% of all the money
they loaned you. And the bank still owns your house. You've just experienced the
music industry.

> That's the way it is, and that's the way it's always been.
Now, I'm not saying that there's not good parts to having a major label deal.
Yes, they've got the relationships at radio, they've got the relationships at
the video outlets, there's so much money at stake, that they make sure that they
keep their stake live. So they're much bigger players than you will ever be as
an independent. That is fine. However, if you're able to make a win-win situation
happen, which a lot of people are doing. â€“ I mean, Subpop started out as a little
independent â€“ basically what you do is you're an entrepreneur, and you have a
band that's started to build a big, hopefully huge following, and you can have
a lot of leverage. That's how Nirvana started their whole thing. Yes, they signed
to DGC, but they really actually started on an independent first. It was a joint
venture.

> I think there's so many ways for artists, new bands and new artists,
to be savvy. To actually do the research, go out there on the web, and go down
to the bookstore. So many great books that they can learn, that actually explain
the terms of the music industry. I'll finalize my little diatribe on the music
industry to say this: after you've learned absolutely everything as far as how
the music industry worksâ€¦ forget it, because it doesn't work that way.

> How it really works, and I will say this as 'personal relations', the music industry
is about personal relationships with everybody. It's about favors. It's about
who just happens to like your band. Also, you have the manager who did a favor
for Joe Schmo when he was the night-time jock at some station in Podunk, Iowaâ€¦
who is now running Clear Channel. You know what I mean? That's the way you take
your career from playing by all the rules, and you can really get that one opportunity.
You need to make sure that your shit is together, so that when the sun shines
on you, you are ready for your opportunity. That's your job. They say that it's
all about luck. But the definition of luck is when preparation meets opportunity.
You can actually make sure, based on the team that you surround yourself with,
you have better chance of having opportunities, and you as an artist can make
sure that you are prepared. So the ball is really in your court.

**WM:** So all
of this knowledge that you have about the music industryâ€¦ was that too little,
too late for you?

> **GN:** Not at all! I'm still in the game. 

**WM:** As
far as Geffin is concerned â€¦

> **GN:** No, I mean all of that stuff is such
a valuable lesson for me to learn, but it was also a different time, man. If you
think about this, all that stuff was going down 8, 9 years ago. Think about how
much the industry has changed in 8 or 9 years. I'm not talking about the music
itself, I'm talking about the way people do business. All of the major labels
are scrambling right now. I mean, downloads? Just in general, as a concept? What
a terrifying concept for them! Think about it! What do you mean, we don't have
a stranglehold on the public now? You mean, just because we owned all the trucks
and decided what was in the record store racks â€“ you mean, we don't have that
anymore? What are we going to do?

> What the record industry looks like
they're going to start having to do, which is good, is rather than treating the
artists like they are pains in the asses, and necessary evils that they have to
just put up with, the labels need to start working with the artists if they want
the artists to start working with the labels. Up until now, it's always been,
this is the name of the game, it's our way or the highway, take it or leave it.
Then when the whole download thing happened with Napster, they had the balls to
come back to the artists and go, they're ripping you off! And the artists are
going, no, we don't make any money from you anyway! The fans aren't ripping us
off, you guys have been ripping us off forever, and then you want us to come to
you and help you guys out?

> I think it needs to be a win-win thing. I think
that definitely there has to be some kind of a profit-sharing standard. It has
to be, 'Hey, you know what, as a label, if we've got artists that are smart enough
or have a big enough name or whatever, we will rent their material from them.
And give it back to them as their retirement fund. That's only fair. We're going
to whore them out and we're going to make millions of dollars, and then when all
is said and done we will allow them to retire on a comfortable existence if they
are savvy enough to re-license their material to people. That's like step one.

> Songwriting, publishing, I think that's really the only income string where an
artist really does get hurt. When the whole thing was happening with free downloads,
I think it's important for kids to know, for people to know in general, and this
really only applies to people who write their own music, which I happen to do,
downloading hurts the songwriter. In an era where â€¦ you know, in Nashville there
are a lot of people who are just songwriters, they're not artists as well â€“ you
know, a songwriter/artist can make up for loss of income by going out on tour.
But then again, I gave you what the downfall of that was. But, they can get hurt
just by their stuff being freely shared.

> As a person who also performs
as well, who is a live artist, it's a catch-22 for me because I want people to
make my music a part of their lives. So it's kind of like, pay as you exit. If
you like my stuff, you'll come to my show, hopefully, one day, you'll buy a ticket,
you might take some of your friends, and you might buy a t-shirt or three when
you leave. And that's cool. And then it's a win-win thing. You know, I'm glad
that my song is a memory to you, and I'm glad that it anchors you to a time in
your life that was a pleasant memory. Or a relationship that you really liked.
Or something. Anything. But do me the solid too â€“ I helped you out, help me out
too.

**WM:** Do you own the masters of your albums that were on Geffin?

> **GN:** No. I do not. I do not own After the Rain, and I do not own Because They
Can. Those are the only two records that are on Geffin. I own everything else.
I own Imaginator, The Silence is Broken, Like Father, Like Sons, Brother Harmonyâ€¦
those kinds of records. I own those, those are great. But also, my re-record restrictions
are up, so if I ever wanted to faithfully reproduce, I mean down to the T, what
I did on those first records, I always could.

**WM:** So when there is an '80s
compilation, and Nelson is on it, you don't see anything from that?

> **GN:** No. It's my gift to all of you!

**WM:** (laughs) Thank you!

> **GN:** You're
welcome. 

**WM:** So royalty checks from Geffin are pretty much a dreamâ€¦

> **GN:** Yeah, they are a dream, but you know what, it's totally ok. You can't rape
the willing. Realize this, we knew what we were getting into when we got into
it. Geffin was the game to get into. I mean, God bless those people, because without
their hard work, and without their expertise, and without their belief, there's
no way in the world I'd be in the Guinness book right now. So that's something
I can enjoy for the rest of my life. I don't care if it cost me millions of dollars,
it's something that my grandkids can brag about. I'm alright. But lesson having
been learned, at this point now, it's all about balance. Just like life, it's
all about balance. There's got to be a little give to a little take. I'm not saying
that the record companies are the enemies. They're businessmen. They're trying
to pay for their expense accounts and the big cars, and all that kind of stuff.
I dig it. I understand it. It's funny, it's like my quote, "It's a good gig if
you can get it." As long as there are garage bands that are literally willing
to sign away their first born child, they are going to have the upper hand in
all negotiations.

> But things are changing a little bit. People are getting
smarter, and the technology is flat-out changing. To the point where people can
literally â€¦ think about this, fifteen years ago, if you were to tell me I could
have a 32 track state-of-the-art, 2496k studio on my home computer, for $1200,
are you kidding me? The only reason why people really had to go to the majors
back then for the recording fund, is because you had to do the recording in a
huge-ass studio with a quarter-million dollar budget. To even rent those studios
back then, it was $1200 a day. And that's not including engineer, tape or producer.
Nowadays, you can do this shit at home! You grab your m-box, you deliver it on
your I-pod. So the distribution, and the production, it's all changed.

> It's both a good and a bad thing. With the advent of Autotune, a lot of people
who can't sing all of a sudden become singers. So it goes from being an artform,
and goes into being product. That's kind of a drag. I love a lot of the stuff
that's out there. That's cool. But then get that person on stage, and they have
to dance around with the little headset mic that's never on, singing to track.


> American Idol. Hey, look, that's wonderful. I think Kelly Clarkson's fucking
awesome! But they should call it Karaoke Idol. You want to make it a real competition,
make them write their own songs. Then it will be legitimate. Shoot, man, when
I go see U2, I know U2 is writing their own songs!

**WM:** There's a tv show
right there.

> **GN:** Exactly right! I have a feeling that the talent pool
would be slightly thinner! Escapism in entertainment is all really great. At the
bottom of all of that stuff, we're all in the business that we're in because we
love music. We love music. It's not just about the product, it's not just about
the sales, it's not just about the time on the video outlet channels. Man, when
I want to put myself back to summer camp, 1979, I put on Led Zeppelin 4, and I'm
there. What I want, I want a new Led Zeppelin. Get me excited about that, you
know? The '80s, what a great decade that was. Every act that came out wanted to
sound different. If you think about it, all those singles on pop radio, their
goal was to sound as unique and different as they possibly could. They wanted
their own individual sound. 

> Unfortunately, like in the '90s, there's a
whole bunch of music that was rewarded for sounding the same. I think now, whether
you're talking pop, rock, country, what I really am encouraged by, I'm hearing
some great tunes that are coming out where I'm going, man, that sounds unique.
That lead singer sounds different. That chord progression is really great. I'm
starting to get stimulated by that. There was a whole period of time where I couldn't
tell what band was what! Honestly, I really couldn't. I'm not taking any of the
validity out of it, I'm just saying I really couldn't tell the difference between
one or the other.

**WM:** Your hair in the '80s was synonymous with you, as much
a part of Nelson as your harmony was back then.

> **GN:** Yeah, for better
or for worse. (laughs) Everybody knew who we were.

**WM:** Do you still find
that people associate you with the two twins with the long blonde hair?

> **GN:** Yeah, you know, I suppose so. I think it's going to be our responsibility
to kind of cruise through that until we get some other video up there, that kind
of re-introduces people. It's so funny, tv kind of keeps a personality kind of
trapped in somebody's mind, in that place. A lot of times, they see them a few
years later, and think, 'Oh, gosh, he looks so different!'

**WM:** Do you see
you or your brother popping up on any of these reality tv shows that are the rave
right now?

> **GN:** No, no, I don't think so. I don't think we'll be doing
any of that stuff. We'll be doing stuff that's scripted. But the whole Surreal
Life thing? It's not really my style.

**WM:** Do you act?

> **GN:** Yeah!
We entertain.

**WM:** Yes you do.

> **GN:** Actually I just got a radio show
on the morning dj for Lifetime Radio's morning show. It's a National Show, I actually
start on the 16th of this month.

**WM:** What is the premise of that?

> **GN:** It's all about self-betterment and self-improvement, but it's an adult contemporary
station. It's called "Balancing Act", it's about finding balance in your life.


**WM:** So being it's Lifetime, it's geared more towards women?

> **GN:** Thank God! (laughs) I love that, I'll take that all day!

**WM:** Working with
your brother day in, day out, what's it like? You grew up together, I'm sure you
had the brotherly spatsâ€¦

> **GN:** Well, no, not really. We were never the
Everly Brothers, let's put it that way. It was cool. We had a turbulent upbringing,
and my brother's always been my best friend. I'm very thankful for his being my
brother. He's a great guy.

**WM:** There's two different types of musicians:
you have the road dog, and the musician who is made for the studio. What are you
personally?

> **GN:** Got one foot in both buckets, man.

**WM:** Really?

> **GN:** Yeah. I know a lot of road dogs, they hate going in the studio. And I know
a lot of guys who are just built for the studio and hate going on the road. They
both have their blessings and their curses. They really do. You give up a lot
to go out on the road, but then you get to meet your fans. So that's great.

> Being in the studio, hey, that's great. You get to be creative, go in there,
and make your internal vision a reality, and that's great. It's like â€¦ I don't
know how else to put this. It's really a magical experience to hear something
in your head, and then a day or two later, hear it coming out of the speakers
exactly as you envisioned it. That's a wonderful thing. But then again, you don't
get any kind of feedback at all, like being on stage. There's nothing, nothing
like the feeling of being on stage, looking out over 5000 people that are singing
your lyrics back to you. 

**WM:** That'd be a trip.

> **GN:** It is, it's
a trip. It's great! It justifies for you all the stuff you go through, and the
sacrifices you made to get to that point. You see that and think, this is really
great. But then again, I love going back in the studio and coming up with new
stuff. 

**WM:** So now you are going to be doing several days in Green Bay. Is
it going to be an acoustic show?

> **GN:** Yes, this particular engagement
is going to be an acoustic show, it's going to be the same show people saw us
opening for Peter Frampton and Styx with. It's just the two of us doing it. Which
is kind of cool, it's not like a watered down band show at all, or a cost-cutting
venture, or anything like that. It's not like Nelson-lite. It's a way for us to
really tell the stories behind the songs â€¦

**WM:**: Like VH-1 Storyteller?

> **GN:** Yeah, between the songs. It's not a sleepy show. I think you get a lot more
connection this way than you do with the band.

**WM:** Also, Nelson-lite would
only be like one of you!

> **GN:** Yeah! (laughs)

**WM:** As far as your set
list, what are you doing?

> **GN:** Well, it really depends. We're going to
read the audience like we always do, we've got four hours of material to pull
from. So, we've got nine albums worth of our stuff, we've got our dad's tunes
that we can play as well. It really depends on our read of the audience when we
get there and what we want. I guarantee you they'll hear no less than an hour's
worth of top 5 songs or above.

**WM:** Any plans for a dvd?

> **GN:** Yeah,
eventually. We're putting together a whole new trip right now. Got new management
together, got a new agency together, and more importantly got a new band lineup
together. So the next six months time is going to be spent pulling that whole
creative thing together. 

**WM:** Now's the time, man.

> **GN:** Now's the
time, I'm ready to do it!

**WM:** Are you going to be able to grab some of your
older MTV videos for that dvd release?

> **GN:** Oh yeah, we'll do something
that's comprehensive. 

**WM:** And at your show in Green Bay, I'm sure you'll
have merchandise with your cd, t-shirts â€¦

> **GN:** We absolutely will, and
if there's something there that you want that we don't have with us, you can always
get it through our website. Same cost, we just beam it right to you.

**WM:**
Sweet. And the website isâ€¦

> **GN:** www.thenelsonbrothers.com, all spelled
out. Otherwise you get a plumbing company.

**WM:** Last question: anything to
the Wisconsin music fans that have supported you through the years?

> **GN:** You know, this part of the country is really our bread and butter. The folks that
actually come to see our shows when we're in Wisconsin are salt of the earth people,
who I would say, quote "get it". Man, we really, really enjoy playing there,
at this particular casino. What I had the most fun with, last time I went there,
is the Packers were playing the Tennessee Titans. I'm from Nashville, and it was
great. I got to go to a block party the day before one of my shows there, and
I hung out with people I never met before and had just the time of my life. It
was really just great. So, I don't know, I know it sounds trite... but it feels
like a part of me is coming home, I'm really looking forward to the visit. 

**WM:**
But you're going to root for the Packers this time.

> **GN:** I don't know
about that! (laughs)

While some might remember the band Blessid Union of Souls as a one hit
wonder, they actually were a staple of Top 40 radio in the 90's for several years.
Just when they seemed to be at the peek of their career with "Hey Leonardo (She
Likes Me For Me)", it was followed up with a greatest hits that mostly fell on
deaf ears. Now four years later they're back with a new album, some new members,
and a new start. Read on, in this exclusive interview with lead singer Eliot Sloan.

**WM:**
It's been documented that you came up with the name Blessid Union Of Souls from
a M.A.S.H. episode. Are you a big M.A.S.H. fan?

> **ES:** Totally. Absolutely.
I've been watching it for a long time. In fact I started ordering the DVD's when
they come out with each season. Pathetic! (laughs)

**WM:** Let's talk about the
roots of Blessid. Who out of the band did you first meet?

> **ES:** Jeff and
I started the band. We had some mutual friends playing in a couple of different
bands. In fact our old drummer, Eddie Hedges, told me about Jeff. Jeff and I started
doing some touring in a band that he had put together. And pretty much started
to work on new songs together, and see what we came up with. He wanted to write
originals and so did I. So Eddie kind of brought us together.

**WM:** It's been
ten years ago this month that your first album came out.

> **ES:** I know,
it's crazy.

**WM:** From what I remember, your song I Believe just exploded on
the charts.

> **ES:** Yeah, it was the first single out of the box. That was
just a blessing. It's one of those songs that just struck a nerve in people, and
they had to keep hearing it. You can't try to do something like that, I can't
anyway. (laughs) It's just one of those things that happens. God just blessed
us with those words and that melody. Realistically, it's a very simple song. It's
only four cords throughout the whole song, but the message is just really strong.
People just kind of latched onto it.

**WM:** You had two different versions of
the song. Did you ever face any controversy because of the word nigger in it?

> **ES:** Some radio stations had a problem with it and some didn't. Some stations
were worried about what the listeners would think. So we switched that around
to appease them. But I never do it like that in concert.

**WM:** So looking back
at the past ten years, what are some of the highs and lows of your career?

> **ES:** As far as the highs, it's a continual high. We've always dreamt of doing
this. Writing original songs, touring, having fans sing along with us at concerts.
There's just so many benefits to what has gone on that the low points of the band
were not really low points. They were more just like stumbling blocks and distractions.
Like when the record company (EMI) went out of business. Jumping from one record
label to another, one booking agent to another. All that is minute trivia compared
to all the good that has happened with this band and is still happening. I really
can't think of any really really low points. You don't always obviously have a
number one record, but you can't compare it to that. That's something that doesn't
happen to everybody, and even when it does happen it doesn't happen all the time.
Every band has their arguments and disagreements and things of that nature. But
I can't complain, I wouldn't change a thing.

**WM:** You mentioned your stumbling
blocks, EMI going under being one of them. There also was when your song 'Standing
On The Edge Of The Earth' was meant for the movie Armageddon, but they went with
the Aerosmith song instead. If either of those would have went the other way,
do you think anything would have changed for BUOS?

> **ES:** Probably, I don't
know. Maybe a little bit more notoriety or recognition. We dwelled on those things
when they happened and we wished they would have went the other way at the time.
I always believe that things happen for a reason. That would have been a totally
different road we would have been on, if Stand On The Edge would have been in
Armageddon. It might have been a better road in some ways, and it might have been
worse in others. It's too hard to predict. If you wish it would have done one
thing and you could just pick the things out that you could have taken from that.
But there might have been some bad things that came from that, you never know.
Right now we have a new manager, we're out of our old management contract and
record contract. So it's a fresh start. So the success of Standing At The Edge
might have prolonged that. We may still be under certain contracts that we don't
want to be under. So it's kind of hard to say 'I wish this would have happened'
Well, you don't know what you're wishing for, because you don't know what's beyond
that door. I'm one of those where if something happens or doesn't happen, I dwell
on it for five minutes and then I move on.

**WM:** You have a new release coming
out now minus two of the original members (CP Roth and Eddie Hedges). Is their
departure recent?

> **ES:** They left in 2002. So it's going on three years.
May 27th was our last gig.

**WM:** Was it an amicable split?

> **ES:** Heck
yeah, I still stay in contact with Chuck and Eddie.

**WM:** And now you have
two new guys on board, Shawn and Brian. How did you come across those two?

> **ES:** They were in a band with our producer Emosha called 3x Time Loser. So we
knew them for a while. So we'd cross paths a few times, and they're real likable
guys. When it came down (to finding new members), they jumped at the opportunity.
They've been an asset to this band, both musicianship and friendship. We really
didn't miss a beat. The first few rehearsals I was concerned, but they're incredible
musicians and it came together pretty quick. After the third rehearsal, I was
like 'OK, this could work. This could be cool.' You just have to get used to it
not being the same. But doesn't mean that it's always taking a step back. It's
just like Sammy Hagar replacing David Lee Roth. Not better or worse, just different
but still good.

**WM:** Your producer, Matt Senetore (Emosia), is almost like
the sixth member of Blessid. He's been with you through the years.

> **ES:** Yeah, he has.

**WM:** How did you first meet up with him?

> **ES:** He was
signed to Atlantic when we first met him, and he was managed by the same guy who
managed us. He was basically the glue between me and Jeff. We have a lot of similarities
and a lot of differences. When it came down to the music, Matt stepped in. He
took what I brought to the table and what Jeff brought to the table and made it
work. He made us see things and hear things differently on what we could do with
our music. Pretty much since then, he's been the main guy we would co-write with.
On the new album, he produced half the album this time because he's on a couple
other projects and our new manager brought some different producers in. But he
is definitely the sixth member of this band.

**WM:** So let's talk about the
new album. It's long!

> **ES:** Yeah! Well our last studio album was in 2001,
and even then there were only three or four new songs on it.

**WM:** Why was
that? After Walking Off The Buzz you seemed to be on a roll. Why a 'best of 'album?

> **ES:** That wasn't our idea, that was the record label's idea. That's why.

**WM:**
That's too badâ€¦

> **ES:** Yeah, I know. It was too bad. It was just where things
were at the time. That gives you an indication of the relationship with the label
that we had. It wasn't our idea to put a singles album out, and it wasn't our
idea for that album cover. You know what I mean? It was after that that I knew
that when the contract expired, I was running. I'm not anti-record company, I'm
not even going to put the people there down. It was just the relationship that
we had was strained in some ways. But that's just life. It's just where things
were at the time. Not just with the label, but with the band. Things were just
going on. When you're together that long, there's going to be disagreements. When
you got anywhere between three and six or seven people involved, getting people
on the same page gets kind of hard. Things just needed to change.

> So after
that we were just trying to find ourselves and what we wanted to do musically.
So that's why we took our time doing the next record. I don't want to rush and
do anything as far as just putting another album out. Even though I didn't hear
all the music in my head at the time, I knew what I didn't want it to sound like.
So I just basically waited around to hear the things in my head of how I did want
it to sound, and it finally came together. We've got some really loyal fans that
stay loyal to this band, and I just wanted to give them some more music. But not
just more music, but just really good songs. We never liked the idea of having
an album with a couple of good singles and the rest are 'throw-aways'. I wasn't
even really thinking about saving some of the good songs. If you have that type
of attitude, then you're doing it for the wrong reasons. This was all done around
the same time. It's all part of the same family. There was originally 17 songs,
so there was still another one! (laughs) But we had to put a cap on it somewhere.
So it's basically for the fans. We wanted the fans to have a lot of music. That's
something that a lot of people don't do. They'll put anywhere from between 9 and
11 songs or whatever, with a couple of good songs on it. I have a different mentality
when it comes to that. I wish there could be 16 singles off this record.

**WM:**
'I Still Believe In Love' sounds like a beautiful sequel to 'I Believe'. Was that
your intention?

> **ES:** That wasn't done intentional, otherwise I would have
done it years ago! (laughs)

**WM:** It's 10 years after your biggest smashâ€¦

> **ES:** Well, the first line of the song is 'Ten years from now and we're right
where we were.' It kind of is, but it really isn't. I could not sit down and write
a sequel to 'I Believe'. It's a melody that I heard in my head, and these are
the words that fit with it. For a brief moment in the course of a half hour, I
was doubting if I should even do those lyrics. That's when I stepped back and
decided not to fight it, and let it be what it is.

**WM:** It's a great song...

> **ES:** Thank you very much. We're blown away at the way it turned out. I did the
demo in my house when we were first recording. I played it for our producer, and
he was like 'When did you record this?' I told him about 3 or 4 months before,
and he said 'And you're just now playing it for me?!?' (laughs) It was just sitting
in my computer for a while. He said that it was going to be the first song we
were tracking.

**WM:** Is it hard for you to get your voice up that high? You're
nailing it in the chorusâ€¦ 

> **ES:** That's an easy note, believe it or not.
That's a falsettoâ€¦

**WM:** That's crazy, it hurts me listening to it! (laughs)

> **ES:** Nah man, I don't do too many things out of my range. That's how you knowâ€¦
because it flows. It's not forced, it flows. That song flowed out.

**WM:** Besides
Blessid, you're also producing. I read that you're currently producing for artist
Holly Spears. Is that something you've been wanting to do for a while? 

> **ES:** Um, somewhat. In a sense that I hear things in the studio. I don't want
to get lost in 'I'm a producer' or 'I'm a songwriter'. You know what I do? I make
up songs and I hear things in songs that would sound good, and the title to those
just happen to be songwriter and producer. So my passion is to basically be in
the studio and make songs sound better. So, whatever you want to call that.

> But Holly is a girl I've been working with for 5 years now. She has a great talent,
a great voice, and she can write songsâ€¦ they just flow out of her. That's the
first thing I noticed about her. She has this knack for writing really good songs
and good melodies. There's a couple times that I tried to co-write with her, but
she has it on her own right now. She's just letting her feelings express themselves,
so I just kind of let her go. But Matt and I will be in the studio producing her
album in the new few months.

**WM:** Not too long ago you did an entire CD for
Cincinnati Reds. How did that come about?

> **ES:** I had some baseball songs
already written. Then when the Reds put up the new stadium, Jeff thought we should
put out a CD based on baseball. We were in the middle of what we were doing as
far as doing another studio album. So basically we wrote 6 or 7 new songs. It
just gave a chance to be silly on some songs and just have fun with it. It was
basically a relief. There was no pressure value on it and it was totally fun.
We sold a few thousand copies of it, and I'm glad some of those songs finally
saw the light of day.

**WM:** Going back to the new albumâ€¦ right now it's available
on the Internet. Are you shopping for a bigger label?

> **ES:** Yeah, we have
distribution and it will be in the stores on May 3rd. I feel pretty confident
about it's potential. It's like anything you come out of the studio with. We'll
see what happens as far as record labels or whatever. The important thing is to
come out of the studio with something you believe in, and we've done that. We
never want to cheat our fans out of anything. We want to come out with good music,
go out and play a really good tour, and give them a good show. We're very proud
of the record. 

> I don't know how much you know about record labels, but
some labels will only pay for a certain amount of songs. I don't really care about
that. I'm going to be dead in 50 years, I don't care about the extra 100 grand
I would have made if they would have licensed these other songs. Give me a break,
you can get lost in all that crap. That's why there's no hockey season this year.
I'm not even a hockey fan. But people forget why they're doing things. They're
arguing over 6 or 12 millionâ€¦ go out there on the ice and play hockey! Society
has lost that. It used to be the music business, now it's the business of music.
It used to be baseball, now it's the business of baseball. Once you start throwing
money into the equasion, it gets all screwed up. So that's the attitude with this
new record having so many songs on it. Let's just put the music out. If I'm going
to lose money because we're giving the fans more music, then I will lose it. I
don't care man, I'm sick of that crap.

**WM:** That's a great perspectiveâ€¦

> **ES:** Yeah, what are you gonna do? 'I would have gave you guys more songs, but
I wasn't making enough money, soâ€¦' (laughs) Co'mon!

**WM:** What personally inspires
you?

> **ES:** First and formost: God. Everything comes from him. Every melody
I hear and every lyric I write comes from Him. Just life around me. I'm moved
by things I see on TV or experiences of meeting people. That's why I like to play
on the road so much, you just meet so many people that you never would have met.
See, that's another thing you can't lose perspective of. The fact that my mother
had me in piano lessons when I was 7 is the reason I'm meeting people I never
would have metâ€¦ doing concerts I never would have done. Doing this interview right
now. You know what I mean? You can't forget all that stuff. And it's that kind
of stuff that just moves me and inspires me when I'm writing songs. We play a
lot of colleges, and I love talking to college students. I get inspiration from
TV shows and movies and stuff. I'll see something in a movie that will trigger
something else.

**WM:** Years ago there was word that you were going to be putting
out a solo Christian CD.

> **ES:** I'm still working on that, actually with
Matt. It's not going to be a solo CD. We're working on a Christian act that's
in it's embryonic form. But song's are being created for that. That's something
that's definitely going to happen.

**WM:** Blessid has shot about 6 videos through
the years. You also had a lot of b-side songs or songs that were on compilations.
Are their any plans to release those to the fans, like in a fan club or website
type pressing?

> **ES:** Yeah, I think that's something we're gonna do in the
midst of this record. There's a lot of b side songs or songs that weren't singles
that we feel very strong about, so we may re-record some of those or maybe do
an acrostic version. We're all about doing stuff for our diehard fans.

**WM:**
I thought every song on your solo EP that you put out last year was a hit. Do
you recycle songs or song ideas?

> **ES:** One of the songs on the EP is on
the new Blessid album, we just changed the name of it and added more production
to it. They may show up again. 

**WM:** Any message to Wisconsin music fans that
have supported you through the 10 years?

> **ES:** We've played so much in
Wisconsin, there ain't noting but good people up there. Tell 'em thank you for
all their support. I know we're gonna be up in La Cross, but we plan on doing
a lot more stuff up in Wisconsinâ€¦ when it gets warmer. You guys have got some
horrible winter weather! (laughs) But I love it up there.

**WM:** One of your
first shows with the new guys was in Green Bayâ€¦

> **ES:** Yeah, I remember
that because we had to drive past Lambeau. 

**WM:** Are you a football fan?

> **ES:** Yeahâ€¦ baseball, football, basketball.

**WM:** Are you loyal to your Cincinnati
teams?

> **ES:** I used to be, but nobody stays on the team long enough anymore
to be loyal. You can't have a favorite player anymore because they're gonna be
traded as soon as their contract year it up. It just has ruined it. In the day,
you had the same team. You may have had a couple of changes, but you had the same
core.

**WM:** Brett Farve will be staying another year for the Packersâ€¦

> **ES:** I heard that. See, he's a real man. That guy IS football. I'm glad he got
a (Superbowl) ring, but I'd love to see him get one more before he goes. He just
has to stop throwing those picks though, man. But when you think of football,
Brett Farve is the epitimy of all out, in your face football. I love it.

**WM:**
Keep talking like that, and your Wisconsin shows are going to sell out! (laughs)

It's safe to say that every band out there has borrowed something from
another band along the way, either in look or sound. What makes a band stand out
is when they take what they borrowed and make it their own. When Motley Crue first
hit the scene, nobody knew what to make of them. Throughout their career they
re-invented themselves from album to album, never taking themselves too seriously.
Now, as they start what might possibly be their last tour, Nikki Sixx checks in
with Wisconsin Music on all things past, present and future. Read on in this exclusive
interview accompanied by 3 audio clips: 

**WM:** Hey Nikki, how're you doing?

> **NS:** Doing good, man.

**WM:** You're in Florida?

> **NS:** I am in Florida,
yes.

**WM:** How have the first few shows been?

> **NS:** We only did one
â€“ well, I guess Puerto Rico, but Puerto Rico doesn't really countâ€¦

**WM:** I
won't put that in the interview... (laughs)

> **NS:** (more laughs) No, I just
mean â€“ the people count, but it wasn't really a show, it was just a musical rehearsal.

**WM:**
So your first show was last night then?

> **NS:** Yeah.

**WM:** How was it?

> **NS:** Considering how much we have going, production-wise and the whole trip,
I'm surprised â€“ totally surprised â€“ that it was so good. We've never in twenty-four
years run through our show before the show, and we've never in that many years
played that long, even in rehearsal. We're notoriously fuckin' lazy. We'd rather
drink and fuck than rehearse.

**WM:** (laughs) And that's changed?

> **NS:** (more laughs) And anything's different? So, with that being said, last night we
played â€¦ someone said two and a half hours. We didn't even know, we just wrote
down a set list that we liked, and we're like, "Well, this might be a bit long!"
(laughs) Not for us, but even some fans were like, "I love you guys, but I went
to see Metallica and they played for like two hours and I was like 'ok', and you
guys played like a half hour longer than that, so â€¦" But I don't know, I don't
think we're going to change anything. 

**WM:** So being it's your first gig and
it's so long, how's your stamina?

> **NS:** Oh, fuckin' killer. 

**WM:** Now,
you don't have an opening band, but you're playing a mini-movie?

> **NS:** It's really an intro â€¦ we're in a movie, and it'll be coming to theaters, so it
was fun for us to create something to start our show. And basically, the movie
is called Disaster: the Movie, and it's very tongue-in-cheek. Remember how they
used to do Airplane and that kind of stuff, that would be a take-off on all of
those airplane movies? Well, this is kind of taking the piss out of movies like
Armageddon. And it's really fun. Any time we can take a piss up anything, we do
â€“ including ourselves. So, that's kind of what it is, it's a setup for that, and
it helps lead us into an intermission, and (laughs) I think the movie is going
to be killer. We're actually playing a concert in the movie â€“ claymation versions
of ourselves.

**WM:** So it's your voice?

> **NS:** Yeah, we did all of the
voiceover stuff. This concert, everything from the claymation stuff to the pyro
cues to the aerialists to the midgets to the stilt walkers, the whole thing is
just â€¦ it's a lot of fucking detail. So that what I was saying, forget about the
fact that we play 25 songs â€“ and most people are like, 'how do you remember that?'
(laughs) and I guess it just gets entrenched in your brain â€¦ but there's a lot
of details, and that's why I'm surprised â€“ the lighting, the whole thing, kinda
all came together last night, and it was cool to see the crew and the band â€¦ and
Motley Crue as well â€¦ all being like, "Wow, it worked!" Cause we didn't know,
when you put a show like that together. Our problem is, that we're insane.

**WM:**
(laughs) But you admit it, soâ€¦

> **NS:** We admit it, it's the first step.
Step one. (laughs)

**WM:** How's Mick doing? That's a long show.

> **NS:** You know what? He's like, "Ah, play another half hour, I don't care." 

**WM:**
There were some rumors floating around before the tour even started that there
were going to be possible stand-ins, and different things. All rumors?

> **NS:** Yeah, I know, that shit cracks me up. Cracks Mick up so much that he came
on last night with a white mask on. And he's all covered up and he has a white
mask and he's playing. So, I'm like, ok. I look over sometimes at my bandmates
and I'm like, 'What are you doing?' I think they're insane, that's how insane
we are! One insane person thinking the other person is insane. That's what the
loony bin is.

**WM:** It was how many months ago he had his hip replaced?

> **NS:** Only a couple months. So he comes on the stage in this white mask, and one
of our security guys told us, people were pointing at Mick and he could see their
mouths move saying 'That's not Mick.' (laughs) Like what, we got Buckethead? (laughs)
We have the Phantom on guitar, we're not going to expose his face. 

**WM:** Are
you surprised by the kind of success that Red, White and Crue has had? 

> **NS:** Well, you know what, it was a compilation record that was really put together
for the new fans. We have a growing new fan base, and we said, 'We going on the
road, let's do a few songs, we really don't have time to do a whole album.' We
wanted to get out now, and play now, and the timing was right. There were all
these people calling radio stations, 'bring the Crue, bring the Crue', demanding
us to come play â€¦ And we're like, now's the time. Tommy's thing was going to be
open, Vince's thing, and my thing, and Mick had just gotten the surgery and it
was the best thing for Mick to get out on the road and not just sit at home. So
we cut four songs, and put three of them on this compilation. 

So for a compilation,
even though it is basically 40 songs, to go #6 on the charts out of the box and
to have, I think "If I Die Tomorrow" is #2 across the nation at radio â€¦ Yeah,
I'm fuckin' blown away! 

> Cause you know, that isn't really what it's about.
It's about what happens on stage, whether we can deliver it in a hungry way that
is who we are in our hearts. It doesn't matter if we're 20 or 30 or what. Time
doesn't fuckin' matter, it's the attitude. And I love that. Johnny Thunders was
that way, it doesn't matter. Some cats, Iggy Pop, they're going to always have
that hunger. So if your album sells, that's cool, more people find out about you,
more people get turned on to what we're really aboutâ€¦ which is a live rock and
roll band.

**WM:** Now you said you recorded four songs originally, and three
songs are on the compilation. 

> **NS:** Yeah, there's "If I Die Tomorrow",
there's a song called "Sick Love Song" that we are playing live, and there's
"Street Fighting Man" by the Stones that we cut a really kind of cool version,
and then we did a song called, "I'm a Liar and that's the Truth" which I thought
would have been a great first single because we were telling everybody that we
weren't getting back together (laughs) when we were in the studio actually recording.
We were denying it, we would leave the studio separately and shit like that. We
wanted to try it on, to see how it would fit. We didn't want to get everybody's
expectations up, didn't want to be a cocktease. 

**WM:** Any video plans for
"Sick Love Song" or "Street Fighting Man"?

> **NS:** We're trying to decide.
Right now, radio's really wanting "Sick Love Song", it's quite heavy. Heavy,
as in "Kickstart My Heart" or "Dr. Feelgood", you know, with a little taste
of old school to it, the darker chord combinations. So, I'm like, if you guys
wanna play it! It's great by me if you want to play it, I don't hear anything
like that on the radio. So if they're willing to do it, that's cool, I just don't
want to jump through hoops for people if they're going to play it and have people
go, [snotty voice] "It's too hard, I don't like that lyric." There's a great
lyric that says, "She can't understand normal thinkin' and she drives a sober
man to drinkin'." And somebody goes, "What's that mean" and I go, "What's
the first letters of 'can't understand normal thinking' and they're like, "Oh,
cunt â€¦" (laughs) I'm always trying to slip one in.

> But it was funny, when
"Same Old Situation" was a big hit, and I told the record company, who didn't
even know, that it was about lesbians, they were like, [snotty voice] "Oh my
God, if we knew that we never would have released it." And now, [official voice]
"Oh, that's legendary, I was involved in the marketing of that." (laughs) Fuck.

**WM:**
Have you heard the song by Bowling for Soup?

> **NS:** Yeah, of course!

**WM:**
Did you see the video?

> **NS:** Uh-huh, classic! Loved it! 

**WM:** In that
video for "1985" the bass player wore a great replica of your spandex.

> **NS:** You know, if I would have known those guys before then, I would have gone
and got my outfit for them. How fuckin' cool would that have been? "Hey man,
let me show you how it goes down here, I'm a little manly for it now, but you
can do it." (laughs) Actually had to go get a costume made, that's so funny.

> But you know what was really classic about that was they said, "Since when is
Motley Crue classic rock." They're saying what people are thinking. You sound
like one of the unique few in the press, most are looking for an angleâ€¦ 'What's
the best angle to cut someone's throat?' Well, usually from behind. That's usually
how it works. Obviously, you're not one of those kind of cats. So when they said
that, it was like, this is what people really think. Stop saying what's not true.

**WM:**
I think the difference is that the people in media now are the kids that grew
up listening to "Shout at the Devil."

> **NS:** You know what, you're so
right, and so are the cops!

**WM:** Thank God, right?

> **NS:** In my case,
yes! 

**WM:** You're not going to get arrested this tour?

> **NS:** I got
pulled over. Every single night, for seven days in a row, coming home from rehearsals,
in excess of 100 mph. And every time, they were like, "Dude, I can't wait for
the LA Forum!" I was like 'Whew!' I called my wife, told her I was pulled over
again. She said, "You know what, it is so not cool that you get away with that."
I said, "I know, but it's like 3 in the morning, there's no one on the road!"
And then I get in trouble by the wife. I don't get in trouble by the cops, I get
in trouble by the wife! That's how life's changed! 

**WM:** They're just going
to hand the badge over to her. Maybe the handcuffs too!

> **NS:** Yeah right.
(laughs)

**WM:** Now, it's pretty well documented that there's always turmoil
between Tommy and Vince, and you're always the peacekeeper more often than not.
Do you see anything different on this tour?

> **NS:** Those two guys don't
seem to need any outside input on anything. As a matter of fact, we did something
this year that was not based on animosity. A lot of people have heard about it,
and said it is. We each have our own tour bus. We've never done that before. I've
got five kids and I'm married, Tommy's got two kids and he's been married, Vince
just got married again, Mick's out of a relationship, Tommy's single as well.
We've done a lot in our life, we've covered a lot of miles, done a lot of everything.
To have that little bit of space -- now, me and Tommy have recording studios built
into our bus â€“ but just to have that little bit of space, to actually have a bedroom
instead of a bunk, it's really cool. So we said, let's have one big room, that
we call the hospitality room, like always, and then let's have four separate dressing
rooms, and JVC came in and made us these flat screen tv rolling cases with DVD
players and stuff, so it's like each guy has his own space. We all end up in one
of the other guy's rooms all the time. It's just weird, we always end up together,
and as far as people getting along, every time you turn around they're hanging
out. We think it's funny. Him and Vince are just kicking it and all mellow, and
I'm the crazy one now. We've switched personalities! 

**WM:** Now it'll be you
and Mickâ€¦

> **NS:** Me and Mick fighting! (laughs)

**WM:** You've been called
a menace to society for so long, and now you're embraced. Do you savor that, or
do you reject everyone that once basically called you a loser that's never going
to make it?

> **NS:** I think I'm over that. I harbored a lot of resentment
as a teenager, and as a young adult. I still have a problem with authority, I'm
trying to â€¦ listen man, I've got to have a couple of vices! (laughs) Don't completely
clip my wings! But you know, to me, it's a more intellectual anarchy.

> I'll give you an example. I forgive my mom for being a psycho and my dad for being
a loser. You know, I'm not talking out of court, they know I think that, I forgive
them. I had to carry a lot of fucking resentment, that wrote a lot of great music,
so I thank them for that. Now, done with that chapter. Who's next? Line fucking
up. 

> As far as I'm concerned, the music industry is ripping off artists
by going and looking at formats that are controlled and saying, 'This is the format,
and if you'll fit into this format, you can be on radio, and if radio will play
you, MTV will expose you, and MTV will expose you, we'll sell records. So this
is what I want you to do, you're going to look like this, you're going to sound
like this, this is what it's about, and you're going to be a big star'. They're
a menace to artists, because artists are very young, and say, 'Um, ok' 

> Motley Crue, collectively and individually, have done things on our own terms.
Including doing what we're doing right now. So, we go to do the Billboard Music
Awards, right, just to be a presenter, and we walk on stage, and we get a standing
ovation from the industry. Tommy looks at me and we're like, "What the hell?"


**WM:** Was that where Tara Reid introduced you?

> **NS:** Yeah! 

**WM:**
It looked like you guys had some kind of inside joke because you guys were just
gigglingâ€¦

> **NS:** Oh, we always do, Tommy always goes, it's so funny, we'll
be doing an interview, like if you were on the phone with me and Tommy right now,
we would probably forget you were there, we'd just be like cracking jokes. It's
like Beavis and Butthead, and the next thing you know, it's like 'oh yeah, the
interview.' I don't know where that came from, but there's so much history amongst
ourselves, that something reminds us of something, and we start cracking up.

> But it was weird, because we got a standing ovation, and to get back to
my point about what I feel very strongly about, is Ashley Simpson. She probably
a very nice person, and probably doesn't deserve a lot of the shit she's getting,
including me saying things about her in the press. I was speaking to Rolling Stone
and they asked me, what music would be on repeat if I was in hell, and I said
'Ashley Simpson'. Then I turned on the tv and she was wearing a Motley Crue t-shirt.
And I was like 'God! Poor girl's just getting hammered! And she's going to be
getting fucking hammered, she's going to be in the Betty Ford clinic soon! So,
she comes on stage, artist of the year, and got booed off the stage by the very
industry that built her. They turned their back. They (originally) said, 'This
is what you have to be, this is what you have to sound like, these are your songwriters,
this is your format'. Then she got caught with her pants down on Saturday Night
Live, and the industry goes 'Booo!' and turns their back on her. Fuck you for
doing that, that's fucked.

**WM:** Do you think Motley could have made it in
today's musical climate?

> **NS:** Uh-huh. Absolutely. Maybe even bigger. Causes
it's so fuckin' safe. But I will tell you this: there is a fuckin' boatload of
bands coming. And if you want real, real is coming. Cause the rebellion that I
was talking about, it's on the street. And it's coming, and it's going to be in
people's faces. You know what, format's are going to change. Because this is what
the people want. It's not what the labels want, it's what the people want. Radio's
going to get hard. It's not going to be cookie monster hard, it's going to be
hard, great-written songs, rock stars, young bands. Who's the new Ramones, who's
the new Guns 'N Roses, who's the new Motley Crue, who's the new Black Sabbath?
They're coming, they're on the street, they're sixteen, seventeen, eighteen years
old. The next few years are going to be very exciting.

**WM:** This is a question
that's out of the blue, but it's something I've always wondered. Have you ever
heard from Lowenbrau about using the dots on the Motley Crue logo? 

> **NS:** (laughs) No!

**WM:** Either positive or negative? Nothing?

> **NS:** No, I've
never thought about that myself. 

**WM:** You've never hid the fact of where
you got it from... 

> **NS:** I guess you can't trademark an umlaut. 

**WM:**
I always thought they'd try and get press out of it or say something negative,
but I've never heard a thing about it.

> **NS:** Or at least somebody come
up and say, "I work for Lowenbrau." And we'd be like, 'No way!' Thats a good
one!

**WM:** After your Motley tour, do you plan on going back to the Brides?

> **NS:** No.

**WM:** That's over and done?

> **NS:** Yeah.

**WM:** Tracy's (Guns)
been pretty vocal in the last couple of monthsâ€¦

> **NS:** Why do you think
I'm not going back to the Brides?

**WM:** Let's reverse this a little bit. If
Tracy never would have opened his flap, there might have been a chance of another
Brides album with Nikki?

> **NS:** Uh-huh, there was. There always was a plan.


**WM:** Have you talked to him lately?

> **NS:** Um, no. He talked out of
court, and he said very derogative things, and it's not ok. Friends don't do that
to each other.

**WM:** Speaking of 'out of court', you've recently won a lawsuit
against Van's shoes. 

> **NS:** That was fun.

**WM:** Were you intimidated
by going head-to-head with a big company? 

> **NS:** No way! I was going to
win. (laughs) I'm insane. It was so great, cause the Van's attorney is talking,
talking, talking â€“ he's just trying to make me look so bad. And finally I just
lean into the microphone, and I go, "Excuse me, sir" â€“ and the jury's there,
and I go, "I am not a shoe salesman, I am a rock star." And it was like silence.
It was ice cold. And he just looked at me, and I stared at him, and he looked
down. Dude, he caved. It was awesome. (laughs) If I'm going to sell shoes, I want
to fuckin' be paid for it. Because I'm not a shoe salesman. 

> You know what,
I could roll over and walk away from this thing. I'm real busy, no time to be
chasing around this company. But if people don't stand up and do this, it's going
to happen to other people. For me it was about fighting the system again. It was
saying, 'You know what, you don't do this, it's not ok.' You can't do this, you
can't take a picture of someone who has built their image up, I don't care who
it is â€“ who's next, Ozzy, or any other pop culture icon? You can't do that. You
can't use that for your business, it's not ok. 

**WM:** The Dirt was very successful,
and Tommy's book went #1. When can we expect your book The Heroin Diaries?

> **NS:** Well, I think this summer, probably, but I don't know yet. It's about setting
the book up. The book is really, really dark, to the point where some people that
I've talked to have said that it could be a series. And I'm like, where? VH1?
It's a little hard for VH1.

**WM:** It's not going to be on the Lifetime channelâ€¦

> **NS:** Or the History channel! I mean, come on, where? This is some dark shit.
And then conversations have happened since, that this could be an HBO thing, and
like real-life. So I'm like, let me finish the book, let's talk about that kind
of stuff after people have read the book, because that's what happened. Immediately,
people were like, The Dirt could be a movie. And I'm like, look, let the people
vote. And then it did turn into a movie. I have a lot of ideas for the Heroin
Diaries, for after the book, but right now I'm just really focusing on the book.


> And what happened that was very exciting for me, is I have those journals,
from that time, but I also have the other guy's diaries, and I started reading
them too. I realized, there's a pattern when tours start, there's a pattern of
infighting, there's a pattern of making up, there's a pattern of breaking up,
there's a pattern of addiction. There's a pattern of going to jail. There's a
pattern of passion for music. And I was like, wow! January of '81, the same thing
happened in May of '83. And I started staggering things, there would be the actual
diaries with little sidenotes. I was talking with Slash, and he said, "You should
have the writer talk to you and get some input", so now we ended up having all
of the band members, all of the crew guys, Slash, old managers, agents, people
that were around when I was going through certain things, having sidenotes and
notes about what I was going through or writing. So it's like the publisher said,
'This is not just diaries that you're putting out, it's a very interesting dark
journey.'

> And then there's poem that I wrote the day Curt Kobain died,
right after it. And it shows the different dates, and how I would talk shit about
someone who would kill themselves, and leave their kids. So what I'm willing to
do is say, 'Look what a fuckup I was.' And I think it's important to do that kind
of stuff.

**WM:** I can't wait to read it.

> **NS:** I'm excited too! But
it is dark.

**WM:** I'm sure you know who Andy McCoy (Hanoi Rocks guitarist)
is.

> **NS:** Yeah, sure.

**WM:** He has recently gone on the record claiming
that certain things that happened in The Dirt are "pure lies."

> **NS:** (laughs) You know what I love about that? You've got a has-been that never was,
just fuckin' grabbing at straws to get attention. I mean, c'mon man. And nothing
he says makes any fucking sense! You ever read the interview where he said that
his band sold more records than our band? I was like, 'Dude, are you crazy!' [mimics
McCoy] "We sold fifty million records and they sold forty, we were a bigger band
than them." 

And I'm like, 'Dude, why to you care about my ass so bad? You won't
stop talking about it.' He's got a fuckin' crush on me or something. (laughs)
Fuckin' fag.

**WM:** The only way I've actually heard of Hanoi was through everything
that happened with Vince.

> **NS:** Sure. It's a very sad thing to happen,
but dude, stop already trying to get attention for yourself. He's like the drunk
chick at a party, that won't stop splashing everybody. But she has bad tits. Stop!
(laughs) No one's gonna fuck ya, no matter â€“ Andy, no matter how much you talk
about Motley Crue, your band still isn't gonna make it! Figure it out! I mean,
go talk about Keith Richards, maybe that will give you another fuckin' one album
sale. (laughs)

**WM:** Anything to say to the Wisconsin music fans reading this
that have supported the Crue through the years?

> **NS:** Well â€¦ I would want
to say, 'Thank you' first of all. And second of all, 'I'm sorry'. (laughs) And
I think it speaks for itself. Thank you for letting us be who we are, and I'm
sorry we are who we are. We can't help ourselves, we're insane!

Contemporary Christian music has come a long way in the past decade. While
some artists disappear after one album, others enjoy quite a bit of success and
are able to make a lifelong career out of it. Rebecca St. James falls into the
second category, and has been heralded at "the most influential woman in Christian
music." It's been a long journey from her hometown of Sydney, Australiaâ€¦ and
she's not slowing down anytime soon. Read on, in this exclusive interview with
Wisconsin Music:

**WM:** How about a brief recap of your career?

> **RSJ:** I moved to America at fourteen because of my dad's job. He got offered a management
job in Nashville. I'd recorded a little praise and worship album in Australia,
so I just went around singing the songs from that album at churches and youth
groups. A couple guys from a record label, Forefront records, came and saw me
sing when I was about fifteen. I signed to that label at sixteen, and I really
started traveling fulltime then. So it's been about ten years now since that all
began. Quite a journey! There's a lot of times within what I do that I cry out
to God for strength. I've got new song on my album that's coming out next year
called "God Help Me", and I think that song is very honest. There's a lot of
times where I know I can't do what I'm doing on my own, and I need his power.
So it's a good relationship-builder with me and my relationship with God.

**WM:**
You just mentioned your new album. What can you tell us about it?

> **RSJ:** Well, it's planned for mid to late summer, and I'm actually heading into the studio
in February. I did a bit of writing for the album this summer, and wrote the song
"God Help Me", and we're actually doing that on this particular tour. I'm excited
to see people's response to it! It's going back to my rock roots a little bit
more, I grew up with bands like Stryper and White Heart and Petra, so I'm a total
rock chick at heart! I'm really going back to that, my roots. 

**WM:** Now, your
original name is not St. James, it's Smallbone. How did you come up with St. James?

> **RSJ:** Well, my record label had encouraged the name change, because Americans
generally don't know how to say or spell my name. They thought of St. John, because
they thought that sounded British or Australian, and I don't even know anyone
named John. So I didn't want to do that, but James is my grandfather's name, so
it was something that was very close to me. We were just praying about what name
to use. I called my grandma on the other side of the world, after we'd already
thought about St. James, and she had no clue we were thinking about using that.
I asked what family names could we maybe use, and she suggested a few like Beasley
and Smith, and all these others I definitely wasn't going to use! (laughs) Then
she said, "Well how about James, because Jim was James." This was a couple months
after he'd passed away, so it was a total miracle I needed to confirm that was
the right thing to do. 

**WM:** You didn't like Beasley?

> **RSJ:** No! (laughs)
Rebecca Beasley doesn't quite have the ring I wanted!

**WM:** So you became a
national recording artist at sixteen. Growing up, what did you aspire to be? Was
it always a performer?

> **RSJ:** No, no, actually, one of my dreams when I
was a kid was to be in a musical. I think I went and saw "The Sound of Music"
at age six, and I wanted to go and be a part of that musical. I think my mom said,
"When you're eight, you can try out for that!" (laughs) I don't think I ever
did it. But being in the rock opera "Hero" was a real dream come true for me.
I got to do the acting thing, and singing thing, and it was rock! It was wonderful.

**WM:**
Do you see more acting in your future?

> **RSJ:** I'd like to, yeah. We're
actually kind of looking at some opportunities, possibly, for a TV movie for maybe
next year. Just kind of exploring it, and praying about it. If it doesn't happen,
it's not the be-all, end-all. But if it does, I think I would really enjoy that.
I'm a bit of a dramatic person, I think! (laughs)

**WM:** So you've grown up
in the spotlightâ€¦ do you think your ministry has changed from young adult to adult?

> **RSJ:** On some level, I'm probably speaking to more of a broad range of people
now. When I started out, there were families coming, but it was largely teens.
We've always had, on some level, a family focus. But I think that's increased
over the years as I've gotten into my 20s. I've now just put out a book that's
for women, that's my first adult book, and I think that will broaden my audience
some as well.

**WM:** Let's talk about that book. It's titled, "SHE." What
can you tell me about the book? I gather it's geared toward women â€¦ 

> **RSJ:** (laughs) It's on becoming a Safe, Healthy, and Empowered woman of Godâ€¦ so that's
an acronym for SHE. It looks at nine different areas that women struggle with
today. Everything from cultural obsession with beauty, to femininity, to the post-feminist
movement. I think the feminist movement freed women in a lot of ways, but hurt
them in others as well. And we're looking at purpose and mentoring, which is kind
of a lost art today. A lot of women are just kind of doing too much, and living
overloaded lives, so there's nine areas of struggle like that. We're looking at,
"What's the problem, what are the lies that culture has fed us at some level,
and what are the truths from the Bible that can empower us to live." Linda, my
co-writer, and I share from our hearts the things that God has done in our lives,
and the things that we've learned from experience. So we're fully upfront about
the fact that we haven't arrived or anything, but we are in process of becoming
those Safe Healthy Empowered women of God that we want to be.

**WM:** Now, you're
very active in the "True Love Waits" campaign. You not only sponsor it, but
you live it. Have you seen fruit from this part of your ministry?

> **RSJ:** Massive amounts. Ever since the early days that I first started talking about
it, which is probably right about when I first started singing. I started going
to "True Love Waits" rallies at that point. Because I was a teenager and I was
going to "True Love Waits" rallies, they'd offer me to share a couple of words
in support of that idea. It became something that people latched onto with me,
and really young people who would say, "Thank you so much for speaking about
this, it's given me courage to wait." 

I spoke to a pastor recently at a church
in Hollywood, CA, who's 28 now, and he had come to one of my shows when he was
in his late teens. He had been thinking about having sex with his girlfriend that
night, only to hear me talking about saving sex for marriage. He decided to wait,
and then he found out later on that the girl he was going to have sex with has
AIDS. So stories like that. That's quite a dramatic one, but I hear stories all
the time about people that have been influenced by that part of my ministry.

**WM:**
You made worldwide headlines back in May with a quote regarding Britney Spears.
Did you ever hear anything back from her management, or people in her entourage?

> **RSJ:** Yeah, I think we did! (laughs) I think it did get back to her, and the
comment that I heard back was, "Rebecca who?" Then I think some people who listen
to my music then went back to her website, and started defending me. Then somebody
from her website said sorry, they didn't mean for it to get like that. (more laughs)
It was so bizarre for me, because I'm over touring in Europe, and I'm hearing
reports daily about how far this thing has gone! I was just in Europe last month,
and I met a girl there from Canada who read an article in the paper all about
it. (laughs) It's just so wild that something like that, which was really me showing
compassion for her. I know that the life that you lead when you're living in the
spotlight is so difficult. And it was more me just saying I feel sad for her with
the pressure that's being put on her and how that's influenced her life and now
others. And it just ended up becoming this big thing.

**WM:** I think it's great
that it got the coverage that it did. I admire you for your statement.

> **RSJ:** Thanks. I think part of the reason that it got the coverage that it got
was because a lot of people agree. I think a lot of people feel sad for her, and
a lot of people see her as a product of the industry and the pressures of it.


**WM:** You've been quoted that you want to find your love, marry and start
a family. When all that happens, will you continue performing?

> **RSJ:** I
don't think so. That's kind of not in my view, it could be in God's. I'm kind
of a 'take one day at a time' person, and just see where God leads. Evie Tornquist,
she's now Evie Karlsson, was a singer about 25 years ago before Amy Grantâ€¦ and
she's my mentor now. When she got married, she ended up pulling out of the music
scene and just focused on her family and other forms of ministry. So I've always
kind of seen myself following in those footsteps to some level. So we'll just
have to see what ends up happening. But I'd like to be fulltime Mum someday, so
we'll just see.

**WM:** Is Rebecca the individual different from Rebecca, the
performer?

> **RSJ:** I think when friends come and see me, they just got to
know me as Rebecca. It's initially a little odd for them to see me up there, in
that kind professional part of my world. But at the same time, they say it's still
meâ€¦ it's just a different aspect of me. 

There's definitely different hats that
I put on, and probably to some level it's like anybody at the office. They're
not professional at home in their grungy clothes, they're just laid back. Probably
less intense and more fun and laughy! (laughs)

**WM:** When you're not performing,
are you always an outgoing person, are you this bubbly in real life?

> **RSJ:** Yeah, I think I am. I've got to get away and be quiet and not be around people
every now and then because of the pressures of my life. I'm not a total extrovert,
I don't have to be the life of the party all the time. I actually like being one
of crowd quite a bit, and I think that's because most of my life demands leadership
from me. And so when I don't have to be a leader I actually quite enjoy that.
But at the same time, I'm pretty much most of the time a pretty bubbly people-person.
I'm empowered by people, I don't like being alone for long periods of time. I
lived alone for a few months and I hated it. I'll will never do that again.

**WM:**
I take it you have your own place?

> **RSJ:** I'm actually building a house
right now. I'm very excited!

**WM:** Are you ten or eleven years into your career?

> **RSJ:** Well my album came out in '94, so I'm going to say ten.

**WM:** So you're
ten years into it now, let's say ten years down the road: what do you see? Do
you see yourself continuing to perform at this level, or do you see yourself branching
more into the acting?

> **RSJ:** Well, hopefully in ten years I'd like to be
married, and raising a family, maybe doing a little bookwriting, something on
the side. Maybe a bit of acting. I suppose I see my acting possibilities as being
more in the next five years. If doors will open up that way. I don't see myself
doing big movies or anything like that, but like a TV movie. Something a little
more chilled out on the pressure side, that'd be wonderful.

**WM:** Will you
keep your St. James stage nameâ€¦

> **RSJ:** Probably.

**WM:** â€¦ or change to
Beasley?

> **RSJ:** (laugh) No I don't think I'll confuse myself any further
with another name.

**WM:** Out of all the work you've done in the ten years,
do you have a favorite, one that stands out?

> **RSJ:** You know, my Christmas
album, I'm really proud of that piece of work I think because we were taking songs
that were a couple hundred years old but still so powerful â€¦ and doing new arrangements.
It was just a blast. I really enjoyed that work and feel like there's a lot of
creativity in it. That and probably my "God" album were probably my two favorite
pieces.

In the early 80's, several hard rock bands came onto the scene that set
the trend for the rest of the hair bands to follow. Although bands like Ratt,
Motley Crue and Quiet Riot shared similar qualities, one band took the look and
the attitude to the extreme. Twisted Sister's 1984 album Stay Hungry produced
hits such as "I Wanna Rock" and "We're Not Going To Take It", giving voice
to a young generation ready to be heard. Jay Jay French was kind enough to chat
with Wisconsin Music in this exclusive interview:

**WM:** Jay Jay French. Is
that a stage name, or is that your original God given name?

> **JF:** It's
an original stage name. 

**WM:** (laughs) Ok. Now, you're one of the original
founding members, is that correct?

> **JF:** The only one. The band first rehearsed
in 1972. Got together January of 1973 with a completely different line-up. The
line-up that people are familiar with is the fourteenth lineup. So it just took
many years to get to this level. 

> So even though it is considered the original
band, and for all extents and purposes to everybody who buys records, we are the
original band. We're really not the original band, but that's more a historical
point of view than anything else. The other versions never recorded anything,
so it didn't really matter in those terms. It's kinda like Fleetwood Mac, if you
came into Fleetwood Mac in 1977, and you see them today, it's the same band, and
so you think that's the original Fleetwood Mac. Well Fleetwood Mac goes back another
ten years to line-ups that you would never know. And in the same way that's kind
of what Twisted Sister is about. Dee is the fourth singer, there were seven drummers,
three different guitar players, two bass players. We went through a lot of changes.

**WM:**
So what year did the band officially call it quits?

> **JF:** Joey Franco came
in to replace AJ, that was in '87. That band only lasted about six months and
that was it.

**WM:** So you had two albums after your biggest release, "Stay
Hungry", that didn't do as well. Do you feel that they could have or should have
done more? 

> **JF:** Probably. Listening back on "Come Out and Play", there
were some really good songs on that record, and some really weak ideas on that
record. By that time, the band had been fracturing. The band started to fracture
shortly after "Stay Hungry", continued to fracture through "Come Out and Play"
and then completely hemorrhaged during "Love is for Suckers." 

**WM:** And
you continued to tour the whole time?

> **JF:** We did our huge tour on "Stay
Hungry", which lasted about a year. And then we did a world tour for "Come Out
and Play", which did very well overseas, incidentally, much better than it did
over here. We got silver and gold and platinum records for it in Europe, and over
here it just went gold. And we toured here, and then we released "Love is for
Suckers". We didn't go to Europe, we just toured regionally, and that was it.

**WM:**
Were you playing in different bands after that?

> **JF:** The other guys were.
I had stopped for years.

**WM:** So when did Twisted Sister reunite?

> **JF:** Well, I guess 2001, when we reunited to do a benefit for the Widow's and Orphan's
Fund for New York City Police and Fire Department, a couple of months after 9-11.
That was maybe the first show. The first real performance.

> We had actually
played in 2000 in a surprise party for a music executiveâ€¦ he's now the president
of Atlantic Records. And that was just a little private party. We did it for him
because he was responsible for A&R'ing us, that's basically picking out the
songs for our music. His name is Jason Flom. We did the surprise performance for
Jason in 2000, but 2001 really was the performance that signaled to us that maybe
there's life here. Ongoing life.

**WM:** So how was it picking the guitar back
up after all those years? Was it like riding a bike?

> **JF:** Yeah, really
was. Four rehearsals and we went back and just did what we had to do. Given the
band's history of ten solid years in the bars playing four shows a night for 250
nights a year. If you do the math, you're talking 8000 shows. You know, Dee and
I have now stood shoulder to shoulder for 28 years. Eddie's been in for 29, and
Mark's been in for 25. AJ's the baby at 22. So when you have that kind of history,
it's not that surprising. It could be, if you suck. But we don't, so therefore,
it's not that surprising!

**WM:** You did a USO tour last year, how did that
come about?

> **JF:** When we decided to reunite, we thought it would be a
good thing to do on the heels of what we did for the Benefit for the Widow's and
Orphan's Fundâ€¦ to do a benefit for our armed forces. And through a congressman
named Jerry Nadler in New York, he put us in touch with the USO. And they flew
us over to Korea.

**WM:** So you went from being considered a threat in the '80s
by all the Tipper Gores of the world, to doing a USO tour to support the troopsâ€¦

> **JF:** And having generals fight over themselves to get into a photo op. (laughs)
Go figure.

**WM:** That's just incredible. How times have changed.

> **JF:** The irony is not lost, my friend.

**WM:** Your most popular song was "We're
Not Going to Take It", and that was recently thrust back into the spotlight with
the Arnold Schwarzenegger campaign for governor of California. How did that come
about?

> **JF:** Well, the song is kinda one of those anthems, it's always
around, in commercials and movies and sports events. So the fact that somebody
grabbed on to that song wouldn't be any different than deciding on "We are the
Champions" for example. It just happened to be a song that his committee thought
was good, and Dee always was a Schwarzenegger fan. I know for a fact it wasn't
a political statement. He was a big Schwarzenegger fan, that's the reason that
the album "Stay Hungry" was called "Stay Hungry"â€¦ because of Schwarzenegger.
He did it as a fan, and it didn't have any political implications with it.

**WM:**
Wasn't one of the controversial baseball players was using one of your songs?

> **JF:** Yes, he was using "I Wanna Rock". That was John Rocker. And we asked the
Atlanta Braves to cease and desist the use of the song, because we did not agree
with John Rocker's social comments in the Sports Illustrated article. And that
letter that we sent to the Braves was actually published by someone from the Braves,
not from us. It was leaked out by someone there, we had no intention of making
it a publicity gimmick. I wrote a letter and faxed it. Next thing you know it's
all over the place. So my theory was, somebody in the front office hated John
Rocker, and decided to embarrass him. Because we didn't do it. So go figure.

**WM:**
I hope you're getting royaltiesâ€¦

> **JF:** Well, you don't really, when you
have all of that. You get publicity out of it, but anyone can license a song just
to play it anywhere, they just pay ASCAP and BMI fees. It's why you go to ballparks
and these songs come up over and over again, that's just a blanket license. You
get like two cents a play, it's not the money. You get really nothing for it.
What you do is you work your way into the social fabric. So people know what you
are and who you are and connect with it, so I guess that gives you value. So in
terms of Twisted's ongoing ability to earn a living, we are inexorably connected
to several anthems.

**WM:** That's a great thing. It fits right in there with
Gary Glitter, and Queen â€¦

> **JF:** It's the gift that keeps on giving.

**WM:**
Did you know when you made that song it would become an anthem?

> **JF:** No.
I didn't. Cause Dee wrote a lot of anthems, he wrote one or two anthems per album.
So if you were to ask me which one of them would ultimately be the one that would
stay in people's minds, I couldn't have told you. Cause he had a bunch of them.
Thank God some of them did. 

**WM:** You'll be releasing "Still Hungry" on
October 19th. It's the original "Stay Hungry" reworked?

> **JF:** Yeah, what
it was â€¦ originally we were going to release a DVD, which will still come out,
but we had technical problems on the DVD. The flipside of the DVD, there was going
to be this technology called DVD Plus, in which the flipside was going to have
music. So we were going to just do this as an extra value-added bonus, stick in
the re-recorded record, cause we thought, 'hey, what a fun idea.' Let's just re-record
it. Now a little bit heavier, and produced by our bass player. But when the DVD
got postponed, the process of re-recording the album was well into it. So the
label that was going to release the DVD said why don't we release the cd in the
meantime, standalone. I said, if we're going to do that, let's add product to
it, so it's not just the re-release of the record. So we have a whole bunch of
other songs on it. Brand new.

**WM:** Do you have a release date on the DVD yet?

> **JF:** No, there's no schedule on the DVD as of yet. 

**WM:** What's the DVD going
to entail?

> **JF:** Well, hopefully, it's a live concert that we did in Germany
last summer. We're just having real technical problems trying to get the audio
files out of the hard drive that recorded the show. It's becoming a real problem,
so we have it in a data recovery service right now.

**WM:** In the press release
for "Still Hungry", you made the comment about how the original had a thin mid-range
kind of sound, and you battled Atlantic and Tom Werman, but the band lost in the
end. Tom Werman has responded to your comments. What are your feelings on what
he had to say?

> **JF:** There's no point in continuing on with this. There's
so much we could say about Werman. Basically, we fired a firecracker, he fired
a hand grenade. If I decide to shoot a howitzer, it doesn't do anybody any good.


> Let's just say this: We didn't re-record it to get back at anybody. We
re-recorded the record because we thought it was a fun thing to do. And it just
redressed some history. There's nothing wrong with the first record, it sold huge
amounts, and it was the right record at the right time. But our fans have always
felt that all of our records were never truly representative of the band's sound.
We're much heavier than our records were. So this was an opportunity to heavy
up the record. You could do it to all of the records, for that matter.

**WM:**
And it's going to have different artwork?

> **JF:** It's going to have the
original concept cover. 

**WM:** So now it will have a band picture of everybody
sitting around a table? Was that a picture taken back in 1984?

> **JF:** Yes
it was, the picture on the back of the album is really what the front cover was
going to be, with visions of ghostly images behind each member of each member
in makeup dreaming about being a rockstar, but starving in basically a cold water
flat. And that was the original concept. But at the time we made it there were
technical problems with the photoshoot, and they didn't have the digital editing
that could make really quick changes. The label had this other option and they
just ran with it. So that's what happened. 

**WM:** So you've already had your
tour last year, and now you're doing one-off dates. Is there any talk of a new
studio album down the road?

> **JF:** There's always talk. We've been talking
for 20 years about it. It's a matter of time, it really comes down to time. We
want to get this out, and get the DVD out. Then sit back, play some shows next
year, and then really evaluate what it would take to make a record. 

**WM:**
How has the response been on the road?

> **JF:** The response is better than
ever. The shows are bigger than ever, better than ever, and we're better than
ever. If you thought we were good 20 years ago, you'll be floored now.

**WM:**
Tell us about your alter ego, Bent Brother?

> **JF:** It was just a fun idea
we had a couple of years ago, to just go on stage wearing t-shirts and jeans and
play Twisted songs and covers. It's really for real fans, to come down, cause
the show is just us playing music. And an assortment of stuff we don't normally
play. Real old obscure stuff.

**WM:** When you went out doing those dates, did
you advertise, this is Twisted Sister sans makeup?

> **JF:** No. It's just
Bent Brother. You only know about it, if you know about it.

**WM:** So I'm sure
there were some people in the crowd who didn't have a clue who they were going
to see.

> **JF:** Not at the price we charged, no. (laughs) You wouldn't be
paying that money for something you don't know. You'd be standing outside going,
'why is it so expensive?' And someone would go, cause that's Twisted Sister without
makeup. (more laughs) But you're not wandering in, seeing us and going, 'what
is that?'

**WM:** Your show will be on Thursday at the Oneida Casino. It's going
to be full-blown makeup, wigs, the whole nine yards? 

> **JF:** Whatever it
takes to replicate '84. 

**WM:** Now, you started a production company, is that
correct?

> **JF:** I've had a management and production company for years.

**WM:**
Really, how's that going?

> **JF:** Great. Sevendust is signed to it, and my
partner and I manage a pop artist named Tina Sugandh. She's an Indian, as in Bombay-born,
female pop artist. She's gorgeous, looks like Miss World India, and is incredibly
talented. She plays guitar, drums, keyboards, and she writes all her own songs,
and her pop album will be coming out in the first quarter of next year. 

> We manage a band called "The Sound of Urchin", an alternative rock band on Hybrid
records. That's "The Sound of Urchin", don't ask me what sound "Urchin" makes,
I don't know. If you listen to their album, I guess you'll find out the sound
an urchin makes! (laughs)

> And we manage a dj producer-remixer duo named
Ming + Fs. If you go into the Rebellion Entertainment website, you'll see our
artist roster. If you go into the Twisted Sister website, you will see all of
the Twisted information, we'll keep you up to date.

**WM:** Any message to the
Wisconsin music lovers that are going to be seeing you Thursday night?

> **JF:** Well, we haven't done that many dates in the Midwest. We've mainly done
our shows in Europe, and some shows in the New York area, and a couple shows out
West, and it seems that Wisconsin really likes the band. So, we're really looking
forward to coming back there. It's going to be very interesting. I don't know
what the venue looks like, but we're really really looking forward to it. The
last two years, we've had an amazing time playing at the Rockfest. We played with
Alice Cooper two years ago, and Judas Priest this past summer and we had a great
time, an absolutely great time. We love playing. We don't play a lot, so every
show means a lot to the band.

Many if not most music acts from the 80's have settled for becoming a
novelty act. They tour, and play their songs that people associate to their memories
of the past. And that's IF they still are together. Firehouse is one band that
has not only excepted this role, but they still strive to put out new music that
is true to who they are. They have a new CD out, titled Primetime, and are currently
touring to support it. Wisconsin Music recently caught up with guitarist Bill
Leverity to find out the latest in the world of Firehouse.

**WM:** Primetime
is getting rave reviews! Tell us a little about this new album. Was creating this
album approached differently than other FH albums?

> **BL:** We just wrote
the best songs we could and picked the best ten. We wrote from the heart and collaborated
more on this one. We're very happy with the way it's turned out.

**WM:** You've
just recently released a new solo cd, Wanderlust. When did this project start,
and what can you tell us about it?

> **BL:** I have been writing songs that
fit my voice and style for about 3-4 years now and finally had enough to make
an album. I never actually said, "Alright, I'm going to make a solo album now."
It just sort of happened over a long period of time. I got Michael Foster to play
drums on it and I had the late, great Bruce Waibel play bass. I did all the vocals,
guitars and keys. It's similar to Firehouse music, but with me singing. The overall
sound of the album is a bit more Southern and bluesy I'd say.

**WM:** Firehouse
has stayed a steady force in melodic rock through the years. What has your band
done differently than other rock bands? How different is this when it's no longer
embraced by the mainstream?

> **BL:** We stayed true to our roots. When grunge
came into vogue, we didn't put out a grunge record. We put out a melodic rock
record. We also still manage to get good enough gigs which enable us to keep the
occupation of "musician" possible. Lastly, we all get along well with one another
and that's crucial. Everyone gets an equal vote, so there's no dictatorship.

**WM:**
Wisconsin music fans love Firehouse, and we're lucky enough to have you pass through
here several times a year. Is your reception the same where ever you play? Are
their some states more than others with diehard Firehouse fans?

> **BL:** I
think that the midj

**WM:** What's it feel like to know your songs are still
played at weddings all over the nation?

> **BL:** That is such a gratifying
feeling. We have so many people that we meet who tell us that they used our song
on their special day and we always thank them.

**WM:** Do you ever get tired
of playing the same songs year after year?

> **BL:** Not at all. I love playing
every song we do.

**WM:** Any plays for a Firehouse DVD, or re-issuing previous
albums?

> **BL:** DVD, yes. Releasing old stuff, no. We want to move forward.

**WM:**
Many bands have recently started releasing demos and/or unreleased tunes. What
are your thoughts on that, and would Firehouse release uncovered gems like that?

> **BL:** We've never released any demos and I don't think we will. We like the idea
of making our songs sound the way we want them to sound, and quite often, demos
sound differently.

**WM:** Do you recall the first Firehouse gig?

> **BL:** We played many gigs under our old name, WHITE HEAT, and had to change the name
later for legal reasons. Our first gig as FireHouse was at a drive-in theater
in Maryland. It was a lot of fun.

**WM:** In closing, anything you'd like to
say to your fans in Wisconsin?

> **BL:** Thanks so much for sticking with us
for so many years. Please check out our new music at "firehousemusic":http://www.firehousemusic.com
