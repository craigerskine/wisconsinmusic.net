does seems to be larger than life, and their concert at the Resch Center was no
exception. For anybody that had doubts that maybe they are past their prime, their
performance speaks for itself. Fireworks, confetti, flames, flying in the air,
and some classic rock anthems made for a memorable night.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-08-10-kiss-mast.jpg!\r\rThe
Dead Daisies started things off with their brand of high energy, gritty rock n’
roll. Lead singer John Corabi sounded great vocally and was playful with the crowd
between songs. One time singer of Motley Crue, Mr. Corabi was actually in Green
Bay last September for a solo acoustic show at the GB Distillery. Many fans didn’t
seem to know the songs, but that didn’t stop them from clapping along. One such
song, \"Long Way To Go\", really showcased the amazing guitar work from Doug Aldrich.
Finishing with a great version of the Beatles \"Helter Skelter\", the Dead Daisies
showed why they deserved to open for such a big name.\r\rIf anyone in attendance
was confused on whom they were about to see, the huge curtain in front of the
stage made it clear that Kiss would soon grace the stage. \"YOU WANTED THE BEST?
YOU GOT THE BEST!\" Suddenly the curtain dropped and fans were treated to the
sites and sounds of Kiss. Lead singer Paul Stanley pranced around on stage like
he was a much younger man, and bass player Gene Simmons looked as menacing as
ever. There's definitely a love affair between Kiss and their fans. You could
feel it in the air! The energy and passion that was coming from the stage was
being given right back to them by those in attendance.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-08-10-kiss-02.jpg!\r\rFrom
\"Detroit Rock City\", to \"Deuce\", to \"Shout It Out Loud\"... the songs and
even certain choreographed moves have been ingrained into their fans over the
decades. When it came time for 'the Demon' to do his bass solo, which is identical
to what he's been doing since the 70's, it was no less interesting to watch! Not
to say that everything was completely the same as it always has been. The lights
and lasers look much better now than they ever have. No longer is there the huge
Kiss logo behind the stage that lights up. Now there's a video screen that can
not only replicate the classic band logo, but also show video and a live camera
feed. It was a great mix of tried and true blended with the latest and greatest.
\r\rAt one point Paul Stanley boasted that there was no pre-recorded vocals or
back up tracks, and you could tell he wasn't bluffing. The vocals weren't always
on key and his voice cracked numerous times. But rock 'n roll is more about feeling
and less about perfection! Besides, who expects to go to a Kiss concert for the
spot-on vocals? I highly doubt anyone in attendance was complaining. Gene Simmons
did a better job with his vocals, but he also wasn't running around as much as
Paul was.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-08-10-kiss-03.jpg!\r\rSome Kiss
fans are upset that Kiss continues to tour without Ace &amp; Peter and instead
have Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer dressed up as them in full costume. Other fans
are just happy that they can continue to see their heroes in concert. Myself,
I fall somewhere in the middle. I think some of their best material came from
the 80's when they were Kiss without the face paint. Could they pull that off
again? Perhaps. But in a world where things are in a constant state of change,
it's comforting that for a few hours you can go into a Kiss concert and time stands
still. \r\rThe night ended with the one song you would expect them to close the
concert out with: \"Rock And Roll All Nite\". The confetti started flying and
the fans were singing along almost as loud as the band. When it was all said and
done, the house lights went back up signaling the end of the concert. The huge
screen behind he stage declared \"Kiss Loves Green Bay\". Right back at ya, Kiss.
