  content: "Those in attendance at the *Weidner Center* on January 13th for the *Femmes
    of Rock / Lita Ford* concert were treated to an big budget, Las Vegas-style show
    for the price of what they would have paid to see their favorite bands back in
    eighties at the *Brown County Arena*. But here, decades later, things are different:
    the venue and sound are better, the lighting is better, and let’s throw in some
    fog, lasers, pyro and fireworks for good measure. If you missed this show, you
    missed out!\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/asorlive1.jpg! \r \rThe show kicked
    off with an all-female band from the *Appleton Rock School*. When this group of
    local girls piled on the stage, it seemed as though we were in for a cute little
    set. Then they started playing! It was truly amazing to watch these girls, a little
    hesitant at first, perform each song better than the one before it. Several of
    the girls had amazing voices that soared above the music. Wait, did that little
    girl on guitar hit a classic windmill just like *Pete Townshend*? Those that were
    playing instruments looked incredibly comfortable as they nailed one song after
    another! By the end of their set they received a standing ovation. What a great
    experience for these girls, and what a treat it was to watch them.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/litalive1.jpg!
    \r \rIt was a little surreal to watch these young rockers be followed by the queen
    of metal. *Lita Ford* took the stage to perform a blistering hour-long set with
    many of her hits over the years. Her guitar playing is as distinct as her voice,
    and both were in fine form. Her band was tight and they sounded great vocally
    as well. One non-Lita highlight was the killer drum solo by veteran drummer *Bobby
    Rock*. It was clear from the crowd reaction that they were longtime fans, singing
    along word for word. \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/litalive3.jpg! \r \rBefore
    playing the *Runaways* classic _‘Cherry Bomb’_ she name-dropped its inclusion
    on the _\"Guardians Of The Galaxy\"_ soundtrack, which had the younger audience
    members cheering. The last two songs, both from her self-titled release _\"Lita\"_,
    were clearly the songs everyone were waiting for. _‘Close My Eyes Forever’_ sounded
    amazing, with guitarist *Patrick Dennison* doing a fine job singing *Ozzy Osbourne’s*
    lines. By the time *Lita* played _‘Kiss Me Deadly’_ the crowd was on their feet
    and singing every word back to her. Her set was great, but it would have been
    nice to have at least one encore. After all these years, she still has it in spades.
    \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/forlive5.jpg! \r \rThe *Femmes of Rock* started
    with a blistering rendition/solo of the _‘Star Spangled Banner’_, and then set
    the mood for the night as they ripped into *Metalica’s* _‘Enter Sandman’_ and
    *Nirvana’s* _‘Smells Like Teen Spirit.'_ Each member of the *Femmes* is a master
    on the violin, but it’s clear that this show is the brainchild of founder and
    arranger *Nina DiGregorio*. Each *Femme* had her own style of playing and they
    matched each other’s energy very well. They were all over the stage, following
    the driving music played by their band move for move. And although it’s not advertised,
    they are all wonderful singers! \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/forlive2.jpg!\r
    \rWhile I’ll go on record and say I’m not a *Pink Floyd* fan, their cover of _‘Dark
    Side Of The Moon’_ blew my mind. It was hauntingly beautiful. *Nina* played her
    solo with so much talent and passion - it was flawless. Their covers of classic
    songs by the *Beatles*, *Led Zepplin*, *AC/DC*, *ZZ Top*, *The Who*, *Queen*,
    *Kansas* and *Guns N' Roses* sounded so nature and alive. The selection of songs
    they played were well-thought-out and performed to perfection. And the production
    was the cherry on top of the sundae. The lights looked amazing with well-placed
    pyro and fireworks in all the right spots. \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/forlive3.jpg!
    \r \rAs they wrapped up their set, a gentleman in the audience screamed out _‘FREEBIRD'_.
    The ladies then lit into that song like they’ve been playing it all their lives.
    I have to admit, at first the song seemed like an odd choice to close their concert
    with. But the extended jam at the end of the song was too incredible for words.
    *Christina Rose*, *Chandra Meibalane*, and *Carissa Werner* came into the crowd
    and wailed on their violins like there was no tomorrow! By the time the house
    lights came up, everyone in the audience was in awe of the *Femmes of Rock*. *Green
    Bay* was just Femmed! I only wish more people could have experienced it. Take
    my word for it, this is one band you will NOT regret seeing. Add them to your
    bucket list!\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/forlive4.jpg!"

  content: "A Rival Sons album showcases their take on rock - warranting comparisons
    to Led Zeppelin, the Doors, or contemporaries like The Raconteurs. But don't worry
    about Rival Sons’ ability to set themselves apart - just catch one of their shows.\r\rKicking
    the night off with the first track on their latest release, _Hollow Bones_, Rival
    Sons wastes no time indulging their audience with fist-pounding, straight-forward
    rock anthems. It’s clear right from the gate that there is no drop-off in quality
    with their live performance. These guys are at the top of their game. “Hollow
    Bones Pt.1” is a great opener, and the energy stays high as they roll through
    Hollow Bones tracks “Thundering Voices” and “Tied Up”, followed by the 2014 single
    “Electric Man.”\r\rThe next song, “Secret”, instantly becomes one of the night's
    many highlights. The swinging groove reminds me of Led Zeppelin’s fantastic rendition
    of “How Many More Times.” And as this happens to be my personal favorite Led Zeppelin
    song, I could not dig it more.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2rivalsons2017.jpg!\r\rThe
    comparisons don’t stop there. Rival Sons performs the song well past its 4:41
    run time on the album, with striking Robert Plant-esque pause breaks from vocalist
    Jay Buchanan. The improvisational tradeoffs between Buchanan and guitarist Scott
    Holiday may be the closest I’ll ever get to witnessing what Robert Plant and Jimmy
    Page did on stage forty years ago.\r\rRival Sons takes it down a notch to play
    “Jordan”, the first ballad of the night. I was curious to see if the transition
    would unmask any sloppiness that may have been hiding within the heavier rock
    tunes, and was greatly impressed (though not surprised) when Rival Sons displays
    that they are just as tight on the ballads. With stand-out performances from bassist
    Dave Beste and drummer Mike Miley, the strong rhythm section patiently leads the
    band to a well-deserved crescendo, featuring stand out harmonies from Beste and
    keyboard player Todd Ögren-Brooks.\r\rAs the rest of the band leaves the stage,
    Holiday straps on his red Fender Jazzmaster, and joins Buchanan in a mournful,
    traditional blues piece that makes one think of Robert Johnson or Mississippi
    Fred McDowell. This break shows that Rival Sons' influences go beyond classic
    rock, and into American music's long-stretched roots.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/3rivalsons2017.jpg!\r\r“Torture”
    yanks the audience back into the action, complete with crowd sing-a-long parts
    and call-backs to the rock anthems that began the set. “Face of Light” is a song
    of reflection and resolve; and as Buchanan puts it, is about “your children making
    you want to be a better man.” “Tell Me Something” sounds like it should be featured
    in the latest action movie, so it comes as no surprise when I later find out that
    Rival Sons were on the soundtrack for the 2011 action movie Real Steel. And “Open
    My Eyes” is, without question, the kind of song you can imagine listening to while
    driving through a desert highway in Arizona.\r\rRival Sons set the stage for \"Open
    My Eyes\" with a insane guitar solo from Holiday. He cuts from blues shuffles
    into straight shredding and doesn’t skip a beat. And speaking of beat, “Open My
    Eyes” is followed by Miley getting his own shot at captivating the audience with
    a blistering six minute drum solo that would get John Bonham’s nod of approval.\r\rBefore
    playing “Hollow Bones Pt.2”, Buchanan pauses to explain that the song started
    out as a free form jam before becoming a “religious song of praise”, and is “about
    being lost and getting found.” The song begins slowly with a half-time groove
    which allows Buchanan’s vocals to rise above the music. And for the first time
    tonight, I find the music taking a backseat to the lyrics, as if to say, “Hey,
    pay attention to this part.” It’s a long song; complete with an extended period
    of improvised guitar soloing before exploding into badass “hallelujahs.” \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/4rivalsons2017.jpg!\r\rWith
    the crowd eager to join in on one last anthem, Buchanan takes a moment to thank
    the venue crew; their tour manager: the drum and guitar techs; the bus driver;
    and the house engineer before doing their own band introductions. It’s a great
    moment and gets rounds of applause at each recognition made. Rival Sons then lays
    into their closer, “Keep On Swinging”, and the crowd sings out “I keep my head
    down/But I keep on swingin’” as if it were their last words. So many songs could
    be great high points to end on - this was the perfect one.\r\rIt's difficult to
    stand out in rock. A Rival Sons concert makes you listen to rock music with fresh
    ears. Their performance takes their excellent studio recordings, and makes them
    better; and isn’t that the sign of a great band? Rival Sons are a classic good
    time -a time not soon forgotten.\r\r*- review by Justin Christensen*\r"

  content: "_'Green Day in Green Bay!!!'_ Any time there was a lull in the excitement
    from the crowd, that’s all singer *Billie Joe Armstrong* would have to yell. It
    was always met with a roar of approval. It’s hard to believe that in the thirty-one
    years that the band has existed that this was their first time in Titletown. Their
    fans were more than ready to welcome them.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/greenday1.jpg!\r\rI
    believe this is the first time there has ever been a ‘pit’ area at the *Resch
    Center*. Much like how concerts used to be, it’s basically a large open area in
    front of the stage. In the pit fans can mosh, stage dive and surf. Although there
    was a lot of pyro and explosions, it seemed as though that most of those effects
    were reserved for some of their new songs that weren’t as familiar as their hits.
    It’s brilliant really, as that kept the energy level up during the lesser known
    songs. Several times they invited fans up on stage sing, play guitar, and stage
    dive. Most memorable was twelve year old Henry from *Milwaukee*, whom came up
    and played guitar while the audience went wild.\r\rThe songs off the new *Green
    Day* release, _'Revolution Radio'_, blended very nice with their other anthems.
    Songs like _'Bang Bang'_ and _'Youngblood'_ are simple and catchy enough to have
    those not familiar with them to be singing or chanting along by the end of them.
    The band was tight and sounded amazing. *Billie Joe’s* voice was dead on and crystal
    clear over the bombastic sound that *Green Day* creates. Drummer *Tre Cool* was
    rock solid and came out from behind the kit a few times, once to sing the classic
    frat jam _'Shout'_. Bass player *Mike Dirnt* was the least animated of the three,
    but still put on a great show while playing spot on. \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/greenday3.jpg!\r\rI
    have to admit, my knowledge of the band is limited after the release of their
    breakthrough release _'Dookie'_ in the mid-nineties. Then they were a punk rock
    trio that took the world by storm. I’m familiar with all of their radio hits through
    the years, but I was secretly hoping to hear their classic songs. They did not
    disappoint! Of course they played that albums big hits _'Longview'_, _'When I
    Come Around'_, and _'Basket Case'_. But they also pulled out lesser known songs
    _'Burnout'_ and _'She'_.\r\rSome claim that *Green Day* is a punk band. But this
    was NOT a punk rock concert. Yes, there was a pit. And while a few tried to mosh
    near the end of the night, it was short lived. Punk rock concerts do not have
    a keyboard player, back-up singers, and a saxophone solo playing the *Wham* hit
    _‘Careless Whisper’_. No, this was more of a love feast by a band that modified
    their punk roots and infused it with rockabilly and ska. The connection between
    band and fans could literally be felt in the air. There were times that the crowd
    was singing along so well that *Billie Joe* stopped and listened, urging them
    to continue. \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/greenday2_1.jpg!\r\rConsidering
    *Green Day* was on stage for two and a half hours, the time went by quickly. As
    rowdy as the crowd was, there was surprisingly very few incidents. According to
    the staff at the *Resch Center*, the crowd was tame compared to the craziness
    at some of the past country concerts. Perhaps that is because that *Billie Joe*
    willed the crowd to stay with him, matching his energy song after song. He definitely
    knew the right words to say every time to get a cheer from the crowd. \r\rThey
    saved one of their biggest hits for the end of the night. _'Good Riddance (Time
    of Your Life)'_ was the fans last chance to sing along with their heroes. The
    neon green sign behind the band proclaiming *GREEN DAY* changed to *GREEN BAY*,
    a fitting nod to the crowd that yelled and sang along with them for hours. With
    the welcome they received, I think it’s safe to say that future *Green Day* tours
    will roll through *Green Bay* once again.\r\r*- Photos taken by Freddy Cantu*"

  content: "Although a Thursday night might not be the best time to catch a live show,
    that didn’t stop the 500+ in attendance from highly enjoying the *Tom Keifer*
    concert at the *Green Bay Distillery* on *September 8th, 2016*. Not only did music
    lovers get to hear the many Cinderella hits, they also were treated to great music
    from the two opening acts.\r\rIf you’re a rock fan and have been living in Northeastern
    Wisconsin for the past few years, there’s a good chance that you’ve already seen
    *Bad Habitz* perform. For their young age, they’ve already been around the block
    a time or two and have opened for many national acts such as *Hinder*, *Buckcherry*,
    *Lita Ford*, *Sebastian Bach* (Skid Row) and *Kip Winger*. This trio will surprise
    you with not only how young they are but also how hard they rock. This band is
    one to watch! It will be interesting to see how far they can go in the years to
    come. \r\r*Consult The Briefcase* hit the stage hard and gave a blistering set.
    Their look, their sound and over-all vibe is classic rock. The crowd responded
    very well to their bluesy style, especially when they covered the Who and Led
    Zeppelin. Lead singer Paul Becker gives off a great retro vibe as his soulful
    vocals filled the Distillery. If they would have been around in the 70’s they
    would have been HUGE. I highly enjoyed their set.\r\rIt’s only been about a year
    since *Tom Keifer* performed in Green Bay last, but you wouldn’t have known it
    by the crowds response. As his band worked through the great catalog of Cinderella
    hits, they also played a few from his solo release _'The Way Life Goes'_. Tom
    sounded in fine form, especially considering he previously suffered from paralysis
    of the left vocal cord and had multiple surgeries to correct it.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-09-08-tk-01.jpg!\r\rTom’s
    backing band was amazing. I was REALLY impressed with guitarist *Tony Higbee*.
    He played like he was in front of 10,000 people and really gave it his all. I
    was also surprised to see Paul Taylor of Winger on keyboards. As much as I would
    love to see all four members of *Cinderella* on the stage, this band kicked ass
    and sounded great!\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-09-08-tk-02.jpg!\r\rFor
    me, the highlight of the night was when Tom sat down to the piano and gave a heartfelt
    performance of the classic _'Don't Know What You Got'_ with his wife *Savannah
    Snow*. The encore, _'Gypsy Road'_, was a great fair tale-like ending to a night
    of incredible performances."

    does seems to be larger than life, and their concert at the Resch Center was no
    exception. For anybody that had doubts that maybe they are past their prime, their
    performance speaks for itself. Fireworks, confetti, flames, flying in the air,
    and some classic rock anthems made for a memorable night.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-08-10-kiss-mast.jpg!\r\rThe
    Dead Daisies started things off with their brand of high energy, gritty rock n’
    roll. Lead singer John Corabi sounded great vocally and was playful with the crowd
    between songs. One time singer of Motley Crue, Mr. Corabi was actually in Green
    Bay last September for a solo acoustic show at the GB Distillery. Many fans didn’t
    seem to know the songs, but that didn’t stop them from clapping along. One such
    song, \"Long Way To Go\", really showcased the amazing guitar work from Doug Aldrich.
    Finishing with a great version of the Beatles \"Helter Skelter\", the Dead Daisies
    showed why they deserved to open for such a big name.\r\rIf anyone in attendance
    was confused on whom they were about to see, the huge curtain in front of the
    stage made it clear that Kiss would soon grace the stage. \"YOU WANTED THE BEST?
    YOU GOT THE BEST!\" Suddenly the curtain dropped and fans were treated to the
    sites and sounds of Kiss. Lead singer Paul Stanley pranced around on stage like
    he was a much younger man, and bass player Gene Simmons looked as menacing as
    ever. There's definitely a love affair between Kiss and their fans. You could
    feel it in the air! The energy and passion that was coming from the stage was
    being given right back to them by those in attendance.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-08-10-kiss-02.jpg!\r\rFrom
    \"Detroit Rock City\", to \"Deuce\", to \"Shout It Out Loud\"... the songs and
    even certain choreographed moves have been ingrained into their fans over the
    decades. When it came time for 'the Demon' to do his bass solo, which is identical
    to what he's been doing since the 70's, it was no less interesting to watch! Not
    to say that everything was completely the same as it always has been. The lights
    and lasers look much better now than they ever have. No longer is there the huge
    Kiss logo behind the stage that lights up. Now there's a video screen that can
    not only replicate the classic band logo, but also show video and a live camera
    feed. It was a great mix of tried and true blended with the latest and greatest.
    \r\rAt one point Paul Stanley boasted that there was no pre-recorded vocals or
    back up tracks, and you could tell he wasn't bluffing. The vocals weren't always
    on key and his voice cracked numerous times. But rock 'n roll is more about feeling
    and less about perfection! Besides, who expects to go to a Kiss concert for the
    spot-on vocals? I highly doubt anyone in attendance was complaining. Gene Simmons
    did a better job with his vocals, but he also wasn't running around as much as
    Paul was.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-08-10-kiss-03.jpg!\r\rSome Kiss
    fans are upset that Kiss continues to tour without Ace &amp; Peter and instead
    have Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer dressed up as them in full costume. Other fans
    are just happy that they can continue to see their heroes in concert. Myself,
    I fall somewhere in the middle. I think some of their best material came from
    the 80's when they were Kiss without the face paint. Could they pull that off
    again? Perhaps. But in a world where things are in a constant state of change,
    it's comforting that for a few hours you can go into a Kiss concert and time stands
    still. \r \rThe night ended with the one song you would expect them to close the
    concert out with: \"Rock And Roll All Nite\". The confetti started flying and
    the fans were singing along almost as loud as the band. When it was all said and
    done, the house lights went back up signaling the end of the concert. The huge
    screen behind he stage declared \"Kiss Loves Green Bay\". Right back at ya, Kiss.

  content: "Although I was attending this concert in 2016 to see Tesla, REO Speedwagon
    and Def Leppard, it sure felt like 1980-something. Here I was in the Veterans
    Memorial Coliseum to see bands that have had their greatest years in the 80's.
    The Coliseum, which probably looks exactly like it did three decades ago, actually
    felt like a time machine warping me back to the days of excess. Walking past the
    line of women to use the rest-room was total Dèjá Vu: Long hair, Def Leppard shirts,
    and some smoking (indoors) as they wait. Yes, the night was filled with nostalgia.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-08-06-dl-01.jpg!\r\rAs
    the house lights went down and the stage lit up, Tesla kicked off their 40 minute
    set. Many of the songs played were from their debut album, Mechanical Resonance,
    which just happens to celebrate it's 30th anniversary this month. The band was
    tight and they put on a great show even with the little stage room that was provided
    for them. The biggest crowd reactions came from their classics; 'Signs' and 'Love
    Song'. Lead singer Jeff Keith looks and sounds just like he did 30 years ago,
    adding to the nostalgic vibe. Ending with 'Modern Day Cowboy', Tesla was off the
    stage way too soon. This is one band that should have been a lot bigger than they
    were. \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-08-06-dl-02.jpg!\r \rAfter a quick
    intermission, REO Speedwagon hit the stage with a slightly slowed down version
    of 'Don't Let Him Go'. I was concerned by this. Does lead singer Kevin Cronin
    still have what it takes? Many bands that still tour in their golden years often
    slow down or down-tune songs, making it easier for the singers to perform them.
    My worries disolved soon after, as both Kevin and the band put on one hell of
    a show. Although REO has a large staple of hits, several songs played in their
    hour long set never charted. You wouldn't have known it by the crowd reaction,
    but a song like 'Tough Guys' was not a big radio single for them. Yet it seemed
    everyone knew the words and were singing along. They ended with 'Roll With The
    Changes', and left the crowd screaming for more. While some older bands really
    should hang it up, REO Speedwagon proved they still has some gas left in the tank.

    the next band was up long enough for the roadies to set the stage for the 3rd
    and final act of the night. Suddenly it disappeared and fans were treated to the
    sights and sounds of Def Leppard. Kicking things off with 'Let's Go' from their
    latest release, the song had that classic Def Leppard sound. There set contained
    many crowd favorite such as 'Animal', 'Foolin', 'Armageddon It', and 'Hysteria'.
    New songs 'Dangerous' and 'Are You Man Enough' sounded good, fit with the older
    songs, and were received well.\r\rThe one low point of the show was their cover
    of 'Rock On' half way through their set list, which gave fans time to hit the
    bathroom or grab another drink. This song is not new for them, and never seems
    to go over very well. Why they continue to perform it is beyond me. The two encore
    songs, ‘Rock Of Ages’ and ‘Photograph’, were the obvious choices to close out
    the night. Over-all, all three bands sounded great and made this concert a must
    see for the classic rock fan.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-08-06-dl-04.jpg!"

    since the self-titled Boston album took the world by storm. It had everything:
    incredible and instantly identifiable lead guitar, catchy hooks, and amazing vocals.
    Every song was an instant classic! Boston, with special guest Eddie Money, graced
    the Resch Center on May 22nd with music that still sounds fresh and alive.\r\rEddie
    Money started the party with his brand of good time rock that instantly had the
    crowd on its feet. Hits like \"Walk On Water\", \"I Wanna Go Back\", \"Take Me
    Home Tonight\", \"Two Tickets To Paradise\" and \"Shakin\" were performed fairly
    well by the 67-year-old. Although many of the words were rushed -- or more spoken
    than sung -- fans didn't seem to mind one bit, with crowd participation a big
    part of many chorus lines. Lesser known songs such as \"Trinidad\" and \"One More
    Soldier\" weren't sung perfectly, but Eddie sang with heart, and with that familiar
    rasp that has graced the airwaves for decades. \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-05-22-bem-02.jpg!\r\rAt
    the end of Eddie's set there was an unfortunate set-back where his drummer, son
    Julian Money, appeared to lose a drum stick. This didn't seem to sit well with
    'the Money Man.' He verbally berated the young musician while fans chanted \"EDDIE,
    EDDIE, EDDIE.\" Then, as the band left the stage to the applause and adoration
    of fans, it was clear Eddie was not happy with his son and continued to yell at
    him. It was an uncomfortable and unfortunate way to end an enjoyable performance.\r\rAfter
    a short intermission, Boston launched into an incredible set list that kicked
    off with \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" from their Greatest Hits album. Although
    this tour is touted as the 40th anniversary of their first release, there were
    a few songs on that album that were not played. With that said, they did a good
    job of playing songs off each of their albums, including their latest: \"Life,
    Love &amp; Hope.\" I was personally happy to hear a few tunes from their great
    album \"Walk On\", which was released (and mostly ignored) in the middle of the
    grunge-heavy '90s.\r\rWhat's amazing about the current Boston is that it has only
    one original member : master-mind Tom Scholz. Yet I firmly believe many in the
    crowd had no idea the band featured only one original bandmate -- thanks to the
    songs being performed so well and sounding so much like the original recorded
    versions. It's a big kudos to the current line-up, and pretty amazing considering
    how technical some songs are! Singer Tommy DeCarlo sings so much like the late
    Brad Delp it's uncanny. Even his look and stage mannerisms now match that of the
    departed singer. And the rest of the band is filled with topnotch musicians that
    pull off the classic Boston sound with ease.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-05-22-bem-03.jpg!\r\rNaturally,
    all the big hits were played, including \"Peace Of Mind\", \"Don't Look Back\",
    \"More Than A Feeling\" and \"Amanda.\" Deep album cuts, such as \"Rock &amp;
    Roll Band\", \"Smokin\", \"We're Ready\" and \"Long Time\" were performed faithfully
    as well. When it came time for the encore, the band launched into \"Used To Bad
    News.\" A mid-tempo song, it might not have been the best encore choice for a
    crowd begging for more ... but just when some in the crowd started to sit down,
    they were brought right back to their feet with the show closer \"Party.\"\r\rIt's
    safe to say that the crowd highly enjoyed the night. The acoustics sounded great
    at the Resch, and the light show looked spectacular. Here's hoping that Boston
    will fly their spaceship back into Green Bay for another visit in the near future.

    like “Gloryhole”, “Asian Hooker” and “Fat Girl (Thar She Blows)” don’t expect
    insightful social commentary or deep philosophical musings from LA’s Steel Panther.
    What you can expect from the Glam Metal quartet is a hilariously profane and ridiculously
    entertaining homage to the over the top 1980’s Sunset Strip metal scene.\r\rThe
    band delivered on that promise of a good time Friday night to a sold out crowd
    of nearly 2000 at The Sandlot at The Watering Hole in Green Bay WI.\r\rShow opener
    and local favorite, Annex had plenty of family and friends in attendance to cheer
    them on, though their performance was plagued by several technical issues. The
    band never faltered as the the PA system repeatedly cut in &amp; out during their
    solid 45 minutes of hard rock favorites from KISS, Cinderella and others.\r\rAt
    approximately 9:30 Steel Panther pounced on the bare bones stage from a cloud
    of fog and red, blue and purple lights, with the chugging riff of “Eyes Of A Panther”
    from their 2009 debut “Feel The Steel”. As vocalist Michael Starr posed and pranced
    at the foot of the stage, doing is best David Lee Roth, guitarist Satchel and
    bassist Lexxi Foxx delivered choreographed unison kicks, twists and twirls flanking
    drummer Stix Zadinia’s drum riser at the rear.\r\rFrom the opening moments the
    crowd, many decked out in wigs and spandex, emulating their heroes on stage, sang
    back every lyric to Starr. The straight ahead rocker an anomaly in the band’s
    catalog in that it’s neither profane or comic, just a straight up tale of a femme
    fatale on the prowl.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-05-20-sp-02.jpg!\r\rRatcheting
    up their trademark comedic elements the band kicked into “Tomorrow Night” from
    their sophomore release “Balls Out”. A catchy tale of the most epic party ever,
    filled with sex drugs and debauchery of all kinds, but unlike every other party
    song you’ve ever heard, the party of the century isn’t going on tonight, sadly
    it’s tomorrow night. As the crowed joins Starr in the huge hook filled chorus
    he laments “But tonight I’m playing Angry Birds, like a million other stupid nerds.
    Tonight I’m going to burp the worm, by myself”.\r\rThe ensuing 16 song set was
    a mix of both rockers and ballads from the band’s three studio releases, featuring
    such fan favorites as “Just Like Tiger Woods”, Turn Out The Lights”, “Community
    Property”, “Girl From Oklahoma” and the set closing, Bon Jovi inspired, “Party
    All Day (Fuck All Night)”. In addition to their own material the band invited
    a local 15 year old fan onstage to play drums for an energetic, if uneven rendition
    of AC/DC’s Highway to Hell. Not shying away from a little more fan interaction,
    a horde of female fans were also called to the stage to dance with the band for
    another tale of over the top promiscuity, “Seventeen Girls In A Row”.\r\rThough
    considered by some as more of a parody than a musical act, the material is filled
    with hard rocking riffs, blistering solos and catchy sing along choruses that
    are almost impossible to resist. With tongues planted firmly in cheek the band
    celebrates a bygone era with their over the top tales of groupies, STDs, parties
    and the stereotypical trappings of the rock n roll life.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-05-20-sp-03.jpg!\r\rWhat’s
    almost as surprising as the seemingly out of nowhere success of a band of 40 somethings
    playing 80’s style hard rock is that Steel Panther’s fan base is filled with fans
    in their early and mid 20’s who couldn’t possibly remember the mid 80’s glory
    days of MTV and the “hair metal” scene. Not only does the band draw a large number
    of young rock fans, but a overwhelming large number of female fans who embrace
    the faux misogyny for the satire that it is.\r\rNot shying away from turning the
    tables on themselves the members of Steel Panther are quick to become the butt
    of the jokes, with long scripted monologues of smilingly spontaneous stage banter
    that mock each of them in turn.\r\rThe entire show was exactly what a rock concert
    at it’s best can be, a high energy communal experience of people singing, dancing
    and laughing at the same in jokes as they thrust fist into the air or banged their
    heads.\r\rSteel Panther will head over to Australia for a string of dates in June.

    that it was his final farewell tour by his performance. Barry Manilow hit the
    stage at the Resch Center with a smile on his face and more energy than other
    performers half his age. Sure, he might have slowed down a bit from the 1970's
    version of himself, but the connection between himself and the crowd was undeniable.\r\rA
    brief opening set by jazz saxophonist Dave Koz went over fairly well. Especially
    with a medley that had the crowd dancing to snippets of covers by Kool &amp; the
    Gang, Stevie Wonder and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.\r\rWith as many chart toppers
    as he’s had, it was literally one hit song after another once Barry Manilow took
    to the stage. Starting and ending with “It’s A Miracle”, there were several montages
    just to fit most of the songs into his performance. Even so… some of the crowd
    favorites were played in full, much to the delight of those in attendance. “Weekend
    In New England”, “Even Now”, \"This One's For You\" \"Somewhere Down the Road\"
    and “Mandy” sounded just as relevant as they did decades ago. Making use of the
    large video screen behind him, he was able to go back in time and sing duets with
    Judy Garland and a younger version of himself. Nostalgia played a big part of
    the night. It was not only embraced, but it was \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-04-21-bm-02.jpg!\r\rThe
    unsung heroes of the night, his backing band, get huge props for their spot on
    performances and rich sounding orchestration. And when they took a break multiple
    times to let Mr. Manilow perform solo on his piano, a stark contrast to the huge
    band sound, it was magic. Another nice touch was bringing out the University of
    Green Bay Choir for the last few songs.\r\rIn a world full of performers that
    will claim they are done touring yet are back a few years later… one can’t help
    but feel that this is really it for Barry. In his early seventies and with some
    health issues recently, it’s better to decide when you’re done than have your
    health decide for you. His entire career has been handled with humility and grace.
    It’s only fitting that his final tour offers both as well. \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2016-04-21-bm-03.jpg!"

  content: "A few years ago Bret Michaels could have performed in Green Bay, and filled
    whatever hall fairly well. As the lead singer of the band Poison; THE glam rock
    band from the eighties, he has a fairly large fan base from the past few decades.
    But that was a few years ago. The concert he performed this Monday night at the
    Oneida Casino was not filled fairly well, it was PACKED. Credit that to Rock Of
    Love, his hit reality TV show on VH-1.\r\rThe night really should be broken into
    two separate events: the concert, and then everything else. Let's start with the
    concert. It started a half hour late, which only seemed to heighten the party
    mood of the crowd. When the band did hit the stage, they were given a huge Green
    Bay welcome straight from 1987. How odd it was to hear classic Poison tunes from
    a band that wasn't Poison. If you closed your eyes, you'd have a hard time telling
    the difference. I dare say they even pulled off some songs better live than the
    actual band that created them!\r\rBret Michaels, while not as active as he was
    two decades ago, still commanded the stage and the crowd with ease. He played
    up to the fact that Poison started several of their world-wide tours in Green
    Bay, and also that much of the Every Rose Has It's Thorn video was filmed here.
    Obviously the Poison hits received a big fan response, but so did the Rock Of
    Love theme song; Go That Far. He will never win any 'golden throat' awards, but
    that's not why he attracts crowds when he performs. He entertains, both on the
    stage and on his reality show. Everyone loves a simple catchy song, just like
    everyone loves a good cat fight. He knows this, and has used this knowledge to
    build a career that should have no problem continuing for the next decade.\r\rThe
    'everything else' I referred to earlier was something to be seen. Parents with
    their kids, fans from earlier decades, new fans... you couldn't pigeon-hole this
    crowd. Yet they were all there to have 'nothing but a good time'. Forget the economy,
    the change in the political landscape, and the daily bump and grind. You literally
    could feel it in the air! It's clear that there is a love affair between Bret
    Michaels and Green Bay. And by the looks of it, GB won't be voted off the show
    anytime soon."

  content: "!/assets/img/reviews/2015-02-19-mc-01.jpg!\r\rOn Thursday night,
    the 19th of February, the Last Vegas band walked onstage of the Resch Center in
    Green Bay, WI. Dressed in leather like an 80’s glam/rock band, Last Vegas was
    the first underlining group for Motley Crue. The concert started on time, despite
    the fact that only about 60% of fans had showed up for the start.\r\rGuitar player
    Adam Arling is a good musician with a Jimmy Page kind of style. The solos he’s
    able to peel off are much like ones you hear in the metal and hard rock songs
    of the 70’s. Johnny Wator and Danny Smash do a nice job of supporting the already
    powerful Arling.\r\rUnfortunately, Adam’s brother, drummer Nate Arling, wasn’t
    having as stellar a night. Midway through the first song, part of his drum set
    got knocked over. This lead to a roadie having to come help him set it back up,
    resulting with a lack of percussion during the first chorus of the song.\r\rLead
    singer Chad Cherry did a fair job of singing for the night, although it was usually
    hard to understand the words he was trying to sing. Maybe they were having a bad
    night, but the band could-and probably has-sounded better than they did that night.
    Still, they were a good start for the night and I would like to see them playing
    again when they are on fire.\r\rThen Theory of a Deadman followed. As they followed
    the Last Vegas on, the Vancouver group started their set off strong with “So Happy,”
    the first song on their new album, “Scars and Souvenirs.” \r\rWhile they did play
    a lot of heavy-metal songs, Theory did a great job with some of the slower, gentler
    ballads from the new album. Tyler Connolly proved that he could pull off the softer
    and gentler songs with singles like “Hate My Life,” “End of the Summer,” and the
    quiet, piano-led “All or Nothing.” The guys also played the 2003 hit “Santa Monica.”\r\rThat
    being said, they also played the heavier songs that hard rock fans came to the
    Resch to hear. The audience went crazy when the riff from new favorite “Bad Girlfriend”
    came wailing from the speakers. “Got it Made” also got people moving.\r\rSome
    of their songs made transitions that really showed the creativity of the band.
    The organ intro from “Little Smirk” leads perfectly as a sirens’ call into the
    power rock-style verses. Also, the wandering distorted guitar part at the start
    of “By the Way” contrasts amazingly with the pop-rock tone of the rest of the
    song.\r\rConnolly’s soft, strong vocals were definitely a highlight of their performance.
    He sang over the noise of the drums and amplifiers pretty well, although on the
    louder numbers he was sometimes hard to understand. His guitar playing sounded
    excellent also, proving he could sing lead and take a solo or two at the same
    time.\r\rGuitarist Dave Brenner showed he was nothing if not versatile in their
    diverse set. From the quieter, almost acoustic guitar chords at the start of “Hate
    My Life” to the electric power chords in “Not Meant to Be,” Brenner really shined.\r\rServing
    as the backbone of Theory of a Deadman, bass player Dean Back kept the band together
    and shook the walls of the Resch Center. He and Brenner also showed the harmonic
    sides of themselves, backing up Connolly and enhancing the overall vocal quality
    of the band.\r\rWhile Theory of a Deadman wasn’t the headlining act, they definitely
    entertained fans who came to listen to Hinder and Motley Crue, and maybe even
    won over a few of them. They put on a great show, and afterwards they even came
    out to sign autographs for the fans for a little while. With the combination of
    heavy-metal grind numbers and soft, melodic pop-rock tunes, along with lyrics
    you can relate to and laugh at, they made their mark in Green Bay.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/2015-02-19-mc-02.jpg!\r\rAfter
    the bar was set high by Theory, Hinder walked out as the last group before Motley
    Crue that night. Hinder, who is probably best known for songs like “Lips of an
    Angel” and “Better Than Me,” started with some hard-rock jams. They played the
    title track of their album “Take it to the Limit” and, as a nice little surprise,
    Motley Crue guitarist Mick Mars came out and helped them with it. \r\rSinger Austin
    Winkler’s voice is only getting better with time. He showed that he could sing
    hard rock songs just as well as anyone else. As an entertainer, he also did a
    better job than any of the other acts at getting the crowd involved. Before starting
    their new single, “Up All Night,” he taught the audience part of the chorus and
    told them when to sing that part. He did it in a way that didn’t seem tacky or
    arrogant; he actually made it fun for the fans to sing along to.\r\rHinder guitarists
    Joe “Blower” Garvey and Mark King are a force to reckoned with. They can play
    the same electric guitar part and empower each other on one song, then play another
    song in completely different styles and contrast each other, making the song sound
    deeper and more diverse. During their smash hit single “Lips of an Angel,” one
    picks up and acoustic guitar and the other plays harmony notes with his electric,
    leading to a balance of calm, low acoustic guitar chords and a crying, amplified
    solo.\r\rDrummer Cody Hanson is the rhythm of the band. He holds them together
    during the faster, more intense songs, but can also play the beat during their
    softer songs, too. Bass guitar player Mike Rodden makes his bass blend in nicely
    with Garvey and King. However, it would be cool to see him take the front row
    with more of a moving bass line. He is capable of it and would really stand out
    with it if given the opportunity.\r\rHinder ended its set with their first single
    ever released “Go Home, Get Stoned,” where Winkler again got the crowd singing
    along with him. Fans were obviously very pleased with the show, but preferred
    their older hits. When asked by Winkler if they should play songs from the new
    album, fans shouted back “No!” wanting to hear more of the older, more popular
    old songs than the hard rock that Hinder kept dishing out. Even so, Hinder had
    a great show and fans got what they came to listen for. More importantly, they,
    and the other two acts, pumped up the crowd for the biggest act of the night:
    Motley Crue.\r\rMy first thought when Motley took the stage was 'What's up with
    the basic stage?' Motley has always been so over the top when it comes to their
    live shows, you come to expect that. This tour has them on a near empty stage
    with the Hollywood sign displayed backwards behind them. My disappointment in
    the stage setup quickly disappeared when light show and pyro kicked in. The lights
    were incredible, and the fireworks were used often.\r\rI won't rehash the show,
    since it's basically the same show they've been doing for years with a few new
    songs sprinkled in. Those songs, off their new album \"Saints of Los Angeles\",
    went over far better than the songs from the new Hinder CD. Fans knew word for
    word the title track, and nobody left for a bathroom break when a new song was
    played.\r\rWhat was even more disappointing to me than the stage setup was the
    lack of a Tommy Lee drum solo. In fact, the normally spotlight seeking drummer
    didn't even talk on the microphone. In a previous review, I stated how disappointed
    I was with the techno styled drum solo he did back in 2005. Looking back, SOME
    drum solo is better than NO drum solo! \r\rThe overall interaction between the
    band and the crowd wasn't what it has been in the past. They played for about
    90 minutes, with very little stage banter. Lead singer Vince Neil was in fine
    form, both in his singing and his covering the stage. Some can complain how he
    only sings part of the lyrics and has the crowd sing the rest. But that's more
    of his style than a comment on how he's gone 'down hill' as the years go by. Guitarist
    Mick Mars was spot on, as usual. Bass player Nikki Sixx was his entertaining self
    even with the extra pounds that he now sports. Tommy Lee just played the drums
    like a normal drummer. Good, but nothing out of the ordinary.\r\rOverall, a great
    rock show. Again, Motley Crue is about over the top and in your face Rock n Roll.
    Unfortunately, this show just seemed to be more about the music and less about
    the show. Good for some bands, but good enough for the Saints of Los Angles? Time
    will tell...\r\r- Nic Hermann\r- Brett Christensen\r- all photos courtesy of the

    with the departure of lead singer and main songwriter Richie McDonald, you'd never
    know it by attending one of their concerts. When the band rolled through West
    Bend to perform at the Wisconsin State Fair, both the band and their fans were
    ready to have a good time. Despite rumors of ill feelings between band members,
    their comradely and performance were top notch.\r\rPerforming four songs off their
    latest release, Mountains, the new material received overall a lukewarm reaction
    compared to their older material. The stand out song and most touching moment
    was when Richie McDonald sat at a grand piano and played the new song \"Hey God\".
    It's clear that while most of the band wants to rock out, Richie wants to be a
    crooner. And from what I saw from the reaction from the mostly female crowd, he'll
    have success at becoming one.\r\rLonestar played the songs that made them a household
    name such as \"Amazed\" and \"I'm Already There\", as well as playing fan favorites
    \"Comin' Home\" and \"Mr. Mom\". But what surprisingly received the biggest crowd
    reaction was the drum solo at the beginning of the encore. And even more surprising,
    at least for this reviewer, is that it consisted of numerous classic rock songs
    by the likes of AC/DC and Led Zepplin. What a strange musical climate we live
    in today where the country artists seem to embrace rock music from the 70's and
    80's more than the modern rock bands of today. It almost makes me want to buy
    a cowboy hat. Almost."

    Kelly would not be played on stations across America nor would she be on a very
    successful tour promoting her second release Breakaway.\r\rLiving up to the title
    of her current CD, Kelly continues to break away from her association as an American
    Idol contestant, and is definitely on her way to being a full-blown music diva.
    I'm not sure about her fans, but I was personally shocked when she first appeared
    on stage. No longer the cute brunette with a \"girl next door\" vibe, now she's
    a long haired blonde with half shirts showing off her tan stomach. But don't let
    her looks fool you, she's still a good 'ol girl who can sing better than 99% of
    her peers.\r\rShe was all over the place, belting through her hits like \"Miss
    Independent\", \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", and \"Since U Been\". Her energy was
    contagious, and the crowd was loving every minute of it. She was definitely aware
    of her surroundings, acknowledging fans in every direction with her down-home
    manners and charm.\r\rIt's refreshing to see a pop idol who is a literally good
    girl. Not that I'm a prude, but the \"good girls gone bad\" ala Britney Spears
    and Christina Aguilera got old quick. It appears Kelly doesn't need to rely on
    rebelling or antics to make her mark in the music climate. Her humble attitude

    is just right, the crowd is in the right mood, and the band(s) is sonically in
    the pocket. So it was at the Rock Never Stops concert August 13th at the Wisconsin
    State Fair.\r\rI normally focus on the strengths of the concert when reviewing
    and then mention the negatives of it, if any. But for this review, I have to address
    the one thing that kept this show from being all it could be. There were time
    limitations put on the bands, and they were severe. Being this was held on the
    Wisconsin State Fairgrounds, they would not let the concert run past when the
    fair closed. So Firehouse, Ratt, and Quiet Riot were only allowed to play for
    20 minutes each. TWENTY MINUTES! That's 4 songs and some very brief talking in-between
    songs. Cinderella was only allowed to play for 40 minutes. Whatever promoter that
    brought this package into the state fair made a very poor decision by either pulling
    in a tour with this many bands, or having the show at the WSF. It was not fair
    to the bands, and it was not fair to the fans.\r\rFirehouse hit the stage full
    of energy, seemingly comfortable in their role as the \"warm-up\" band. This band
    delivers in a live setting, and this night was no different. I'm not sure why...
    but the tempo of two of their songs; \"Love Of A Lifetime\" and \"Don't Treat
    Me Bad\", were a bit too slow. Normally bands will speed their songs up, so this
    had me a bit curious. One thing to note was that their drummer (Michael Foster)
    did not seem happy one bit. He never cracked a smile while the other band members
    were hamming it up. I'm guessing that it had to do with their extremely short
    set.\r\rQuiet Riot came out next, and they managed to get the crowd to their feet
    and into every song. Lead singer Kevin Dubrow, who looked almost like a Rod Stewart
    impersonator with his highlighted blonde locks and leopard skin outfit, definitely
    made the most of their short set. Fans were treated to their hits such as \"Mama
    We're All Crazy Now\", \"Come On Feel The Noise\", and \"Metal Health\". They
    could have kept going, and I think the crowd wouldn't have minded at all.\r\rThen
    Ratt hit the stage, full of swagger and attitude. Naturally, the biggest bummer
    with Ratt is that it's not even the original lead singer, Steven Percy. Their
    current singer, Jizzy Pearl, seemed more into strutting and posing than to doing
    the songs justice. The rest of the band, which only contain two original members
    (drummer Bobby Blotzer and guitarist Warren Dimartini), sounded fine. But watching
    Ratt was almost like eating imitation crap meat at a seafood restaurant. How this
    version of Ratt was not the opener is beyond me, as both Firehouse and Quiet Riot
    blew them out of the water.\r\rCinderella took the stage, and the crowd was definitely
    ready. The only band on the tour to have 100% of their original members from their
    heyday, they didn't waste a second of their measly 40 minutes. They gave a 110%,
    and the crowd gave right back. Word for word, song after song. Tom Keifer looks
    and sounds like he stepped out of time machine, he hasn't changed one bit in two
    decades. He really could be a one man show, as he floated from playing guitar,
    harmonica, piano and even a saxophone! The biggest change with this band is the
    looks of their bassist, Eric Brittingham. Once the only blonde in the band, now
    the casual fan wouldn't have recognized him with his black locks and facial hair.
    Other than their short set, there's nothing negative I can say about their show.
    It was hit after hit, each one sounding fantastic. \"Somebody Save Me\", \"Shelter
    Me\", \"Coming Home\", and \"Nobody's Fool\" were the highlights of a fantastic
    performance. Add a little pyro, and you have one heck of a concert that gave fans
    a steal for their money. And that's even after the fair short-changed them."

  content: "Being this is a review of the Lifest festival than the actual talent playing
    there, I'll stay away from reviewing the acts that performed during the four days.
    Not to take away from headliners such as Tobymac or up and coming bands like Disciple
    though, as they put on great concerts and are all top notch entertainers.\r\rFirst
    off, this festival is huge. The four day event pulled in 70,000 people from 47
    different states and Canada! That's a lot of people. And if Lifest continues to
    grow like they have, they should really consider holding it at a different location.
    The current grounds in Oshkosh are adequate, but barely with that many people
    coming through the gate. This isn't Summerfest, but if growth trends continue
    they'll need to grow with it.\r\rLifest is a jack of all trades - master of none
    music festival. There are a total of seven different stages, which were host to
    over 150 acts. The only common theme running throughout the diverse line-up is
    their Christian message. From praise and worship, to contemporary, to rock and
    rap. It was many different voices with many different ways of expressing their
    one goal: sharing their faith in Jesus Christ. The festival seems to take pride
    in the fact that they have something for everyone, and they come pretty close
    to accomplishing that. \r\rOne area they are sorely lacking in would be entertainment
    for the 30+ attendees. Sure, there's the contemporary music such as Steven Curtis
    Chapman, but there's a pretty big void from CCM to the current sounding bands
    that kids today listen to. Some classic rock and country bands next year will
    open this festival up to a more mature audience, who will naturally bring their
    family with. The kid zone for the children was nice, but small. This is another
    area where they need to grow with their attendance. But for teenagers, Lifest
    pulled out all the stops. Picture church camp where your family can attend and
    music being the common theme. \r\rLife promotions also relies heavily on the 1,300
    volunteers that help them run the festival. A novel idea, and one that works well
    for them. Again, as this festival continues to grow, they will need to have more
    paid personnel on grounds (planning for growth is a reoccurring theme). There
    seemed to be some miscommunication behind the scenes, and I'm sure that's because
    the actual employees of Life promotions were pulled thin working with the volunteers.
    This shouldn't be too hard to correct.\r\rThe best thing about the festival was
    the people. From the Lifest staff, to the volunteers, to the attendees. You could
    feel it in the air, and see it on their faces. Here's hoping that Lifest continues
    it's trend, making a difference in people's lives while entertaining them."

  content: "Def Leppard returned to Green Bay, and this time they brought their friends
    with. Tesla was a great pick for Def Leppard’s opening band. Not only did these
    two bands tour together back in the ‘80s, they both share the same fan base. They
    sounded incredible, receiving cheers for their hits “Signs” and “Love Song”. Even
    the recent but fairly unknown song “Into The Now” received good feedback from
    the crowd. It was a tight set by a seasoned band. Lead singer Jeff Keith grinned
    from ear to ear, clearly enjoying what he was doing. And it was contagious. Too
    bad they weren’t given a full timeslot to fill, or even an encore. I’m sure many
    Def Leppard fans walked out Tesla fans as well.\r\rDef Leppard hit the stage with
    their version of Sweet’s “Action”, a jamming up-tempo tune but not one that all
    the fans knew. The first thing I noticed was that lead singer Joe Elliot’s mic
    volume was too low. I could hear the backup vocals of his fellow band mates better
    than his. \r\rThey all looked great and all seemed to be in great spirits. But
    everything really comes down to the music. It was a very muddy mix. It would be
    easy to blame this on the Resch Center’s acoustics, but considering Tesla sounded
    crystal clear, that’s not a valid excuse. It was simply a poor mix from the console.
    \r\rJoe Elliot is one of the top front men in rock music, but unfortunately he
    was struggling with the high notes. Considering that many of their hit songs require
    him to hit these notes, it causes a bit of a problem when performing the songs
    live. This was most evident with their hit “Promises”. But my hat off to him,
    he hung in there all night giving it his best. \r\rI personally was hoping to
    hear some songs off of a more recent release “Slang” and their last studio release
    “X”, but being this was a greatest hits tour… they were absent from the set list.
    They did perform two covers off their soon to be released covers album; “No Mater
    What” and “Rock On”. While “No Mater What” sounded great and fit very well with
    their other material, “Rock On” seemed to fall flat. The crowd favorites, “Rock
    Of Ages”, “Photograph” and “Let’s Get Rocked”, were performed flawlessly. \r\rTheir
    encore consisted of “Bringin’ On The Heartbreak” and “Pour Some Sugar On Me”,
    which left their fans walking out satisfied. And there wasn’t a single person
    from either band that came out wearing a Packer jersey. How refreshing! Overall,
    it was a good performance from a very talented band. Here’s hoping the Leps realize
    how poor their mix is, and take steps to correct it."

  content: "The rock n’ roll circus came to Green Bay on April 5th when Motley Crue
    rolled into town with their band of misfits and metal heads on the Red, White
    and Crue tour. As the poster boys for an “excess is best” lifestyle, it’s interesting
    to see how the aging rockers still hold up over time. Although not a sold out
    show (about 80% full), the band was welcomed back with open arms after a 15 year
    absence since their last GB performance.\r \rThere was apparently some communication
    issues at the start of the show, which should have started at 7:30pm. According
    to the Crue’s crew, they had a start time of 8:15pm, which they also did not make.
    It was more like 8:30pm before the lights went down, but since when has a rock
    n’ roll show ever started on time?\r\rStarting out with a brief clip of Disaster:
    The Movie, the Crue then hit the stage with a vengeance. They focused on their
    early songs during the first set, all the while surrounded by flames, sparks,
    dancers, clowns, midgets, fire breathers, bombs, and fireworks. Songs such as
    “Looks That Kill” and “Too Fast For Love” still hold up over time, and came across
    well in a live setting. Either the crowd was unfamiliar with many of the early
    songs, or just in awe of everything in front of them. \r\rAfter a brief intermission,
    the band came back out playing more of their radio friendly hits and crowd favorite
    songs. From “Girls, Girls, Girls” to “Kickstart My Heart”, the crowd sang every
    word back to the band. Absent from the hits being performed was Motley’s version
    of “Smokin’ In The Boys Room”, which was the song that started their crossover
    appeal on M-TV and on the radio waves. They also played two of their new songs:
    “If I Die Tomorrow” and “Sick Love Song”. Although the crowd cheered after each
    new song, it was clear that they were there for the nostalgia. \r\rSinger Vince
    Neil was impressive throughout the show. A few years ago I witnessed the then
    overweight singer at a solo show, struggling to get the words out to each song
    and staggering drunk. Sure, he still relies on the crowd a little bit to help
    him sings songs like “Dr. Feelgood” or “Shout At The Devil”. But considering the
    length of the concert and the rapid-fire way these songs are sung, it’s forgivable.
    \r\rAlthough it was painful to watch guitarist Mick Mars play, it was also a treat.
    Affected by a degenerative bone condition called “anklosing spondylitis”, it causes
    him to hunch over while moving stiff and slow. The disease hasn’t effected his
    playing though. His hands worked their magic over the guitar, almost as if they
    belonged to someone else. He is easily one of the most under-rated guitarists
    around, either from the 80’s or today. \r\rTommy Lee, who has become a mini-celebrity
    outside of Motley Crue, was less than impressive. Most will argue that he is the
    ultimate drumming showman. I won’t deny this, as he is a solid player and has
    a great stage presence. But after much hype over his drum solo, it was simply
    him triggering some electronic drumbeats as he flew from one kit to another high
    in the air. I can appreciate that he doesn’t want to stay pigeon holed as a hair
    metal drummer and he now has a newfound love for electronic and club beats. But
    Motley Crue is about rock and rebellion, not techno sampled beats.\r\rNikki Sixx
    is basically the glue that holds this band together. He is always a strong, solid
    force both on the stage and off. He had his own solo of sorts, which I’m still
    trying to figure out. While plunking out some cords on a keyboard, he was engulfed
    by a shower of sparks. This was followed by the band cranking out “Dr. Feelgood”,
    and somehow they made it work.\r\rThe encore, consisting of covers “Helter Skelter”
    and “Anarchy In The UK”, seemed to fall a bit short since they already played
    all their big hits. But overall, the concert was highly entertaining and definitely
    worth the going price for tickets these days. Fans paid for the concert, but their
    admission to the circus was free."

    of the islands and all but one song was actually written there. It should come
    as no shock then that Chesney’s first of back-to-back sold out shows for his “Somewhere
    in the Sun” tour was as close to the islands as you’re going to get in Wisconsin
    during late March. Also not a surprise is that the sun was nowhere to be found.\r\rNo
    worries; as you all know, “everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.” Fans
    had no choice but to “check their worries” at the door as Chesney instructed and
    enter the makeshift paradise. Chesney’s surprise entrance, from the back- on an
    elevated swing- certainly got the party started, but it was his non-stop performance
    of island-inspired songs, as well as some old favorites, that set the place on
    fire.\r\rIn between breaks to grasp the hands of eager funs lucky enough to cuddle
    up to the stage, and to accept various gifts including Hawaiian leis- among other
    non-mentionables- Chesney, CMA’s 2004 Entertainer of the Year, did what he does
    best. \r\rTanned, toned and with his Old Blue Chair in tow, Chesney brought the
    excitement of the islands to Green Bay, Wisconsin. Way back when, we all learned
    to love him for his more original country hits like, “She Thinks My Tractor’s
    Sexy,” and “Back Where I Come From,” both of which fans were able to enjoy, but
    it’s hard not to love anything that makes you feel like you’re on the beach with
    Kenny Chesney, your favorite umbrella drink in hand.\r\rHis powerful vocals did
    the trick and fans couldn’t help but sing along, umbrella drinks raised, to favorites
    from his triple platinum album, When the Sun Goes Down such as “I Go Back,” and
    the title track, with Uncle Kracker making an appearance in what else but a Brett
    Favre jersey. More favorites from his older album, No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,
    which went quadruple platinum after its release in 2002, helped round out the
    show. It just wouldn’t be a Chesney concert without that title track and of course,
    “The Good Stuff.”\r\rFans will argue that everything about this concert had the
    makings of “the good stuff,” including Chesney’s opening acts. Uncle Kracker,
    although not the typical country artist, was welcomed by the friendly small-town
    crowed and his upbeat, danceable tunes certainly warmed up the place, making an
    easy transition into Gretchen Wilson’s set. Wilson kept the party going with a
    rockin’ rendition of Led Zeppelin’s “Black Dog,” as well as her own titles, “Redneck
    Woman,” and “I’m Here for the Party.” \r\rIt seemed as if every person in the
    Resch center was there for the party, and with live music from country powerhouse
    Kenny Chesney and his opening acts, dancing in the aisles, and of course, umbrella
    drinks, it was the hottest party this town has seen in a while.\r\r- Jenny Agamaite"

  content: "The Colors of Christmas tour debuted this year in Appleton at the Fox
    Center for the first time since it's creation. The artists on the tour this year
    were Peabo Bryson, En Vogue, James Ingram, and Marilyn McCoo. For those unfamiliar
    with the concert, they place several known singers together and sing a combination
    of Christmas songs along with some of their hits. These are normally artists that
    have already peaked in their career (from previous decades), yet have their own
    place in music history.\r\rPeabo Bryson, a staple of the Colors of Christmas,
    is really the glue that holds this show together. He has several hit songs that
    have either produced Grammy nominations or Grammys themselves (ie: Disney songs
    \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"A Whole New World\"), and he is a charmer. Every
    year he will flirt with the ladies in the crowd and talk about world peace, and
    the crowd eats it up. He's a strong singer, and he's smooth.\r\rEn Vogue, once
    on top of the charts in the 90's, seemed to have disappeared out of the spotlight
    for the most part. Now only a trio, I was not impressed with their performance
    on this tour. When they were providing background harmony for the other performers,
    they sounded fine. But when they preformed their hit songs they are known for,
    they fell short. Maybe it was because they were missing the 4th member, or maybe
    it was because most of the songs weren't appropriate for a \"Christmas tour\"
    setting. Either way, they were the weak link on this tour. \r\rJames Ingram was
    an artist that I was the least familiar with. I recognized his name, but could
    not think of a song that he sang. After hearing his hits, I definitely knew them,
    as well as his voice. He is very comparable to Peabo with a strong vocal style,
    yet he lacks the stage presence that Peabo has. He was a little stiff, yet his
    voice was still in fine form. His high point of the night was when he sang his
    hit \"I Don't Have The Heart\".\r\rMy knowledge of Marilyn McCoo comes from watching
    her on the television show Solid Gold in the '80s. Her hit that she performed
    was the \"Wedding Bell Blues\", another song that didn't fit with the Christmas-themed
    concert. The most notable thing to mention of her performance is her outfits,
    which were more bizarre than classy.\r\rThe high point of the concert was a duet
    between Peabo and James, singing the upbeat \"Ya Mo Be There\", which was originally
    a duet between James and Michael McDonald. This rendition was alive and upbeat,
    getting everyone on their feet and clapping along. Again, a song that seemed to
    be out of place at a Christmas concert, but it did wake the audience up.\r\rThe
    low point was directly after \"Ya Mo Be There\", as En Vogue begged people to
    stay on their feet and continue to clap. Going into this concert, I joked about
    hearing En Vogue's biggest hit, \"My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)\". As
    the song started, many in the crowd cringed along with me and proceeded to sit
    down. If there was a list of 101 songs never to play during a Christmas concert,
    this song dentately would be # 1! To add insult to injury, they recruited Marilyn
    to help sing the acappella break-down in the middle of the song. To see the 61
    year old crooner wagging her finger to the audience singing \"You're never gonna
    get it!\", made me feel about as uncomfortable as a teenager being lectured about
    sex from his grandmother. \r\rThe Colors of Christmas tour has many successful
    years under their belt, combining diverse talent with some great music. But after
    viewing the latest installment of this tour, it looks as if they are scraping
    the bottom of the musical barrel. It might be time to retire this tour, but we'll
    see what next year brings."

    for concert goers attending the Tobymac/Third Day concert at the Resch Center
    in Green Bay. The concert started out with a band that was not advertised as being
    on the bill; Trial By Fire. Starting out with a intro video similar to a VH1 Behind
    The Music episode, it was a brief glimpse of this new band. The debut Trial By
    Fire CD has yet to be released, which explained why the crowd was listening more
    than participating. Although they played a very short set, their enthusiasm rubbed
    off on the crowd by their last song. I expect good things to come from this band
    as they develop a fan base and continue to tour.\r\rWithin mere minutes, the stage
    was ready for Tobymac. I have to give props to the management and crew of this
    tour. The concert started exactly on time, and the down time between bands was
    very minimal. More often than not, concerts rarely start on time and downtime
    between bands can drag. During the short wait for Toby, there was a slide show
    featuring the members of Third Day. I think this is a great idea that they could
    take even further with videos or maybe interviews with the featured bands playing
    that night.\r\rTobymac and his crew hit the stage with unmatched energy. Covering
    songs from his two solo releases, Toby launched into one hit after another. For
    years in DC Talk he was known as the one who rapped while the others sang, but
    he showed he can sing with the best of them on songs such as \"Love Is In The
    House\" and the DCT classic \"In The Light\". Unfortunately, being an opening
    act means getting the shorter set. As fans were calling for an encore, Toby came
    out to talk briefly about compassion and then introduced Tai Anderson from Third
    Day. It's a shame that Tobymac wasn't able to play over 45 minutes and there was
    no encore, because it's clear that a large section of the audience was there for
    him.\r\rAfter another brief intermission, Third Day kicked things off with \"Rockstar\".
    The first impression they made on me is how tight they were. They are a well oiled
    machine, and they are a band that is MADE for touring. They all worked the crowd,
    and really personalized the show. This is evident during the song \"Come Together\",
    where they pick several members from crowd to the stage to help them sing. Singer
    Mac Powell is a very gifted speaker, praying with the crowd several times. The
    modest sized crowd hung on his every word, with some crying and raising their
    hands in the air. The encore was made up of the songs \"Show Me Your Glory\" and
    \"Your Love Oh Lord\", bringing the performance to a close. Three very different
    bands and various styles of music, but all with the same vision.\r \rOn a sad
    note, this great show was only seen by few. With the Resch only about 1/4 full,
    it looked and felt empty. I felt bad for the performers who were giving it everything,
    and I felt bad for all those who missed this show. Here's hoping that it will
    be a different story next time around."

    Casino with their make-up and attitude in tact. The audience was rather small,
    with only about 800 in attendance in a room that can easily hold several thousand.
    But what they lacked for in numbers they make up for in energy. Many of die-hard
    fans that have followed the band from the early days were mixed with a surprising
    number of younger concert goers. Lead singer Dee Snider summed up the crowd when
    he proclaimed \"This room is NOT very rock n' roll (referring to the plush carpeting
    and chandlers), but you all ARE rock n roll!\"\r\rThe band was tight, and much
    heavier than their records would lead you to believe. They ripped through song
    after song spanning their 6 studio albums, only slowing down for \"The Price\"
    off their classic release \"Stay Hungry\". There seemed to be a problem with one
    or several of their stage monitors, that became a little distracting as a stage
    hand was running around during the show trying to fix it. Considering that the
    band members are now easily in their 50's, they put on a very energetic show.
    Guitar player Jay Jay French was literally running from one side of the stage
    to the other throughout the show. The drummer AJ Pero was slamming away, even
    though he had bronchitis! Guitarist Eddie Ojeda and bass play Mark Mendoza didn't
    just play their instruments, they attacked them.\r\rOne would think that they
    would save one or both of their big anthems, \"I Wanna Rock\" and \"We're Not
    Gonna Take It\", for their encore. Yet they ended up going out on a lesser known
    fan favorite \"SMF\" and then the same song their played at the beginning of the
    show. This concert seemed put together almost last minute, and with very little
    advertising. Yet with that said, both the fans and the band seemed pleased with
    the outcome."

    the year in the casino's Pavilion Nights lineup. Every year the casino will hold
    several shows in an outdoor tent, and the prices are kept at a reasonable $20.
    I've heard that on a hot summer night the tent is unbearable, but this night was
    cool and a perfect night for the Journey show.\r\rThe sold out show started a
    bit late, due to some keyboard problems they were having. So when the lights went
    down and \"Be Good To Yourself\" kicked in, the crowd was more than ready. Naturally
    they played all of their hits, but it became apparent that they were pulling out
    some more obscure songs to please long time fans. They also each took turns on
    some lead vocals, which not only was fun to watch but really made you appreciate
    how good each band member was vocally. Bass player Ross Valory sang \"Walks Like
    A Lady\", and guitar god Neal Schon sang the Jimi Hendrix cover of \"Voodoo Child\".
    Jonathan Cain handled the piano, keyboards, harmonica, rhythm guitar, as well
    as sang lead on \"Just The Same Way\". The most impressive part of the night was
    when drummer Deen Castronovo sang \"Keep On Runnin\" and \"Mother, Father\". I
    dare say he sang better than lead singer Steve Augeri. I don't say that lightly,
    as Steve is an incredible singer and filled some big shoes belonging to former
    lead singer Steve Perry. But I have to say it again; Deen was mind blowing when
    he sang.\r\rThey ended the night with a blues jam that merged into \"Lovin Touchin
    Squeezin\". Overall, an excellent concert. Journey finds themselves in a situation
    where their new music doesn't sell what it should, yet they sell out concerts
    everywhere they play. They seemed to have acknowledged this, and they are giving
    fans who have seen them numerous times in the past a reason to keep coming back
    for more! Journey has always been a tight band live throughout the years, and
    they will be a touring force for some time to come."

  content: "If the sold out show at the Resch Center is any indication of Shania Twain's
    popularity, she will be around for a long time. The crowd of 10,019 was second
    only to when Elton John played here. \r\rThe opening band Emerson Drive did exactly
    what a good opening band should do: Keep things short but explosive, and pump
    the crowd up. Knowing they were unknowns to most in the crowd, they did a great
    job of playing several cover tunes to get the crowd singing along. They were definitely
    a country band, but they could really rock when needed.\r\rbq. \"Are you ready
    Green Bay?\"\r\rThe crowd went wild with the sound of her voice and her silhouette
    on the stage. Shania Twain launched into one hit after another, only slowing down
    for a few ballads. Pulling from 3 albums worth of material, there was not one
    song that was a sleeper. She looked and sounded great, it was easy to see why
    she's as big as she is. Her band was tight and they gave off just as much energy
    as she did.\r\rThe round stage was set dead center in the Resch, giving any Def
    Leppard fan who saw them in the 80's major flashbacks. (Maybe influenced by Def
    Lep's legendary producer and Twain's husband Mutt Lange?) No matter where you
    were sitting, you had a great view. Shania surprised many when the house lights
    went out during the middle of the set, and then she was actually sitting in the
    crowd with an acoustic guitar! For the encore, Shania came out wearing a Packer
    jersey, which is the thing to do I guess whenever any band or performer comes
    to Green Bay. The use of pyro and confetti bombs at the end of the show was a
    perfect way to end an entertaining show.\r\rI've heard several complaints that
    the show was not long enough. Although 90 minutes is not a long set by today's
    standard, they were the most entertaining 90 minutes I've had in some time."
