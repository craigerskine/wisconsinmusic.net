content: "Those in attendance at the *Weidner Center* on January 13th for the *Femmes
of Rock / Lita Ford* concert were treated to an big budget, Las Vegas-style show
for the price of what they would have paid to see their favorite bands back in
eighties at the *Brown County Arena*. But here, decades later, things are different:
the venue and sound are better, the lighting is better, and let’s throw in some
fog, lasers, pyro and fireworks for good measure. If you missed this show, you
missed out!\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/asorlive1.jpg! \r \rThe show kicked
off with an all-female band from the *Appleton Rock School*. When this group of
local girls piled on the stage, it seemed as though we were in for a cute little
set. Then they started playing! It was truly amazing to watch these girls, a little
hesitant at first, perform each song better than the one before it. Several of
the girls had amazing voices that soared above the music. Wait, did that little
girl on guitar hit a classic windmill just like *Pete Townshend*? Those that were
playing instruments looked incredibly comfortable as they nailed one song after
another! By the end of their set they received a standing ovation. What a great
experience for these girls, and what a treat it was to watch them.\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/litalive1.jpg!
\r \rIt was a little surreal to watch these young rockers be followed by the queen
of metal. *Lita Ford* took the stage to perform a blistering hour-long set with
many of her hits over the years. Her guitar playing is as distinct as her voice,
and both were in fine form. Her band was tight and they sounded great vocally
as well. One non-Lita highlight was the killer drum solo by veteran drummer *Bobby
Rock*. It was clear from the crowd reaction that they were longtime fans, singing
along word for word. \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/litalive3.jpg! \r \rBefore
playing the *Runaways* classic _‘Cherry Bomb’_ she name-dropped its inclusion
on the _\"Guardians Of The Galaxy\"_ soundtrack, which had the younger audience
members cheering. The last two songs, both from her self-titled release _\"Lita\"_,
were clearly the songs everyone were waiting for. _‘Close My Eyes Forever’_ sounded
amazing, with guitarist *Patrick Dennison* doing a fine job singing *Ozzy Osbourne’s*
lines. By the time *Lita* played _‘Kiss Me Deadly’_ the crowd was on their feet
and singing every word back to her. Her set was great, but it would have been
nice to have at least one encore. After all these years, she still has it in spades.
\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/forlive5.jpg! \r \rThe *Femmes of Rock* started
with a blistering rendition/solo of the _‘Star Spangled Banner’_, and then set
the mood for the night as they ripped into *Metalica’s* _‘Enter Sandman’_ and
*Nirvana’s* _‘Smells Like Teen Spirit.'_ Each member of the *Femmes* is a master
on the violin, but it’s clear that this show is the brainchild of founder and
arranger *Nina DiGregorio*. Each *Femme* had her own style of playing and they
matched each other’s energy very well. They were all over the stage, following
the driving music played by their band move for move. And although it’s not advertised,
they are all wonderful singers! \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/forlive2.jpg!\r
\rWhile I’ll go on record and say I’m not a *Pink Floyd* fan, their cover of _‘Dark
Side Of The Moon’_ blew my mind. It was hauntingly beautiful. *Nina* played her
solo with so much talent and passion - it was flawless. Their covers of classic
songs by the *Beatles*, *Led Zepplin*, *AC/DC*, *ZZ Top*, *The Who*, *Queen*,
*Kansas* and *Guns N' Roses* sounded so nature and alive. The selection of songs
they played were well-thought-out and performed to perfection. And the production
was the cherry on top of the sundae. The lights looked amazing with well-placed
pyro and fireworks in all the right spots. \r\r!/assets/img/reviews/forlive3.jpg!
\r \rAs they wrapped up their set, a gentleman in the audience screamed out _‘FREEBIRD'_.
The ladies then lit into that song like they’ve been playing it all their lives.
I have to admit, at first the song seemed like an odd choice to close their concert
with. But the extended jam at the end of the song was too incredible for words.
*Christina Rose*, *Chandra Meibalane*, and *Carissa Werner* came into the crowd
and wailed on their violins like there was no tomorrow! By the time the house
lights came up, everyone in the audience was in awe of the *Femmes of Rock*. *Green
Bay* was just Femmed! I only wish more people could have experienced it. Take
my word for it, this is one band you will NOT regret seeing. Add them to your
bucket list!\r\r!/assets/img/reviews/forlive4.jpg!"
