content: "Journey's concert at the Oneida Bingo &amp; Casino was the last show of
the year in the casino's Pavilion Nights lineup. Every year the casino will hold
several shows in an outdoor tent, and the prices are kept at a reasonable $20.
I've heard that on a hot summer night the tent is unbearable, but this night was
cool and a perfect night for the Journey show.\r\rThe sold out show started a
bit late, due to some keyboard problems they were having. So when the lights went
down and \"Be Good To Yourself\" kicked in, the crowd was more than ready. Naturally
they played all of their hits, but it became apparent that they were pulling out
some more obscure songs to please long time fans. They also each took turns on
some lead vocals, which not only was fun to watch but really made you appreciate
how good each band member was vocally. Bass player Ross Valory sang \"Walks Like
A Lady\", and guitar god Neal Schon sang the Jimi Hendrix cover of \"Voodoo Child\".
Jonathan Cain handled the piano, keyboards, harmonica, rhythm guitar, as well
as sang lead on \"Just The Same Way\". The most impressive part of the night was
when drummer Deen Castronovo sang \"Keep On Runnin\" and \"Mother, Father\". I
dare say he sang better than lead singer Steve Augeri. I don't say that lightly,
as Steve is an incredible singer and filled some big shoes belonging to former
lead singer Steve Perry. But I have to say it again; Deen was mind blowing when
he sang.\r\rThey ended the night with a blues jam that merged into \"Lovin Touchin
Squeezin\". Overall, an excellent concert. Journey finds themselves in a situation
where their new music doesn't sell what it should, yet they sell out concerts
everywhere they play. They seemed to have acknowledged this, and they are giving
fans who have seen them numerous times in the past a reason to keep coming back
for more! Journey has always been a tight band live throughout the years, and
they will be a touring force for some time to come."
